<h2>PREFACE</h2>

<p class="nodent"><span class="smcap">The</span> writing of this little book has been delayed
by the hope I once cherished of incorporating
in it some of the results of the Indian Census of 1911.
This desire was inevitable in the case of a retired
Indian official, who, like most of his kind, has taken a
small part in one or more of the decennial numberings
of the Indian people. In this country, a Census affords
material chiefly for the calculations and theories of
the statistician, and the Registrar-General is not
regarded as an expert in Anthropology or Linguistics.
But in India the case is very different. If the district
officer is always glad to learn as much as possible of
the people with whom he is brought into contact, his
official duties often reveal only the seamy side of
Indian life, and it is only when he is in camp, or
snatching a rare and hurried holiday in shooting, that
he gets to see something of the people otherwise than
as litigants or payers of revenue. A census is an
agreeable and welcome opportunity for looking at
India from another and more genially human point
of view. In the first place, it is one of the least
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">{vi}</a></span>
expensive of official operations, since it is chiefly
performed by unpaid and volunteer agency. Hence
the official, a little weary of litigants, touts, pleaders,
and subordinates, who, however amiable in their
private lives, are apt to be indolent and obstructive
in office, is glad to make acquaintance with new
friends, who, for the most part, take an intelligent
and amused interest in the unfamiliar task of numbering.
For many busy weeks before the actual counting
takes place, the district officer has to ride far and
near, to satisfy himself that all necessary preparations
have duly been made, to issue the instructions that
may be called for by the zeal, inquisitiveness or
density of his volunteer colleagues. In the process,
he has many pleasant and some amusing experiences.
On one occasion I rode into a little village on the
north-eastern frontier, inhabited by semi-savage
Tibeto-Burmese people. Official orders as to the
numbering of all the house in legible figures had
apparently not been obeyed. I simulated wrath and
disappointment, but the worthy headman on whom
I vented my (purely official) indignation was not
dismayed. "Bring out your drums!" he shouted.
Every householder produced the family kettle-drum,
on the head of which the number of his house had
been duly inscribed in large figures. There was no
paper in the village, but parchment was invented
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">{vii}</a></span>
before paper, and the headman deserved the commendation
I was glad to bestow. On another occasion,
I found a house numbered indeed, but grievously
dilapidated and obviously deserted. "Why is this
empty house numbered?" I asked. "It is haunted
by a ghost, sir," answered the enumerator. I confess
I felt sorry not to allow him to include this ghostly
visitant in a census of living men. Other incidents,
more ethnologically important than these, will frequently
occur. In any case the Census Report of an
Indian province is by far the most interesting official
document in existence, and each census adds something
to our knowledge of Indian humanity, if only
because each Census Commissioner, always an officer
of unusual ability and attainments, looks at his task
from a point of view somewhat different from that of
his predecessors, and stamps his individuality on the
work of his subordinates. Those who have read
Mr E. A. Gait's article on <i>Caste</i> in the <i>Dictionary
of Ethics and Religion</i> will expect the census of 1911
to contain new views and fresh information as to
the actual working of the caste system in various
provinces, and its relation to the religious ideas of
the people.</p>

<p class="gap-above">It was natural, then, that I should wish to learn
from a new tapping of the source from which has
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">{viii}</a></span>
been compiled, for the most part, the ethnical portion
of the first volume of the Imperial Gazetteer of India,
which has been my chief authority in compiling this
little book. But I know not when Mr Gait's Report
for all India will be ready, and even the Provincial
Reports come but slowly from the Press. Most of
them are full of the most interesting and valuable
information, but it takes time to assimilate so much
new matter, and, in any case, not much of it could
have been utilized for so small and elementary a
book. Hence I have simply to state my debt to the
late Sir H. H. Risley and Mr E. A. Gait for the
chapter on Race and Caste; to Sir G. A. Grierson
for the chapter on Languages, and to Mr William
Crooke for enabling me further to summarise his
masterly summary of what is known about Indian
Religions. It is a particular pleasure to acknowledge
my indebtedness to my friend Sir G. A. Grierson.
Years ago, when we were young men, it was known
that in him the Indian Civil Service possessed a
scholar and a linguist of most unusual industry and
ability. But few knew that there was germinating in
his mind the scheme for the great <i>Linguistic Survey
of India</i>, the most remarkable feat of administrative
scholarship, perhaps, that has ever been attempted, a
feat that has won him the <i>Prix Volney</i> and I know
not what other appreciations of his work in France
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">{ix}</a></span>
and Germany. His learning and linguistic skill are
widely known, but I must seize the opportunity to
tell of another feature of his achievement. Of course
no man knows more than a few of the hundreds of
Indian languages, but there is one man who knows
something of the working and mechanism of them all,
and that is Sir G. A. Grierson. I had the privilege of
helping him with part of the Bodo volume of his
<i>Survey</i>, having had occasion to learn one or two
Tibeto-Burman languages in the course of official
duty. The practised ease with which he acquired the
syntactical and phonetic peculiarities of languages
with which he had no previous acquaintance was the
most surprising and delightful intellectual performance
I have ever witnessed.</p>

<p>I have ventured occasionally to enliven my chiefly
borrowed narrative with personal ideas or reminiscences.
Such digressions have however been few and
brief, and I do not think I need apologise for them.</p>

<p>I have to thank Miss Lilian Whitehouse and my
son, Lieut. M. A. Anderson, R.E., for the two diagrammatic
maps which will, I hope, clear up any geographical
difficulties created by a necessarily brief
account of a large and complicated subject.</p>

<p>I owe the illustrations of caste types to the
kindness of Mr William Crooke. They are from
photographs of inhabitants of one single district of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">{x}</a></span>
the United Provinces and are interesting as showing
how in a single small area racial differences show
themselves in such a way as to be recognisable
by the most careless observer. They prove once
more how stratified Indian humanity has become
under the influence of caste rules of marriages.</p>

 <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is necessary, once more, to remind the reader
that the peninsula of India has an area and population
roughly equal to the area and population of
Europe without Russia. Everyone who has learnt
geography at school is familiar with the great triangle,
its base in the soaring Himalayan heights in the
north, its apex jutting into the Indian Ocean, and
marked by the satellite island of Ceylon. To the
north, then, is the great mountain barrier, a tangled
mass of snowy peaks, glaciers and snowfields, separating
the sunny plains of India proper from the plateaux
of Central Asia. Beneath them lie wide river basins,
sandy and dry as unirrigated Egypt to the west;
moist, warm, and waterlogged to the east. To the
south of the valleys of the Indus and the Ganges is
the central plateau, home of many aboriginal races.
This rises on the west into a castellated rampart of
hills facing the Arabian Sea, and on the south slopes
away into green undulating uplands. So much, at
least, of geographical description must be given as
a clue to the distribution of the peoples of India.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">{2}</a></span>
Along the Himalayas, growing stronger in numbers
as we go eastwards, are races mostly of a Mongolian
type, mingled with purely Indian elements. In the
Panjāb and the United Provinces, sending offshoots
southwards along the well-watered west coast, are
the peoples in whom the traces of Aryan immigration
are most visible. In Bengal we find a duskier race,
provisionally termed Mongolo-Dravidian, but with
a strong infusion, in the upper classes, of western
blood. In the south are a still darker population
almost wholly Dravidian. It is in the most ancient
part of India, in the high plateau of the Deccan, that
there still dwell the peoples who are probably the
aborigines of the land and use the most purely Indian
languages, the various Dravidian dialects. The geologically
recent valleys of the Indus and Ganges are
the home of races, mingled with aboriginal peoples,
whose language and physical features show that in
them is a strong strain of immigrant blood.</p>

<p>On the Himalayan slopes, in Assam, and especially
in Burma, are Tibeto-Burman peoples, with something
of a Japanese aspect. Intermingled with all
these, in forests and on rough and hardly accessible
hills, are scattered many groups of semi-savage folk,
of whom little was known till the gradual spread of
British rule carried the administrator, the missionary,
and finally the anthropologist, into regions once considered
unfit for the presence of civilised men.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">{3}</a></span>
So far, it may be said, the distribution of Indian
humanity is not very unlike that of the races of
Europe. Even this very crude summary, it is true,
shows at least three great groups of languages,
Dravidian in the south, Indo-European in the west
and north-west, Tibeto-Burman in the north and the
north-east. There are in fact five separate families
of human speech which have their homes in India;
the Aryan, the Dravidian, the Mundā, the Mon-Khmer,
and the Tibeto-Chinese. The lateral spread
of these is, of course, no real indication of the present
habitat of five different races of men. But they do
indicate the existence, in varying degrees of purity,
of five different origins, of which the Dravidian and
Mundā alone can be said to be purely indigenous
and confined to the Indian peninsula. Nowhere is
it more easy than in India to see how languages
spread from race to race, from tribe to tribe, with
a sort of linguistic contagion; the stronger, more
supple, more copious, more cultivated languages
replacing and gradually destroying weaker forms of
speech. Something of the same sort has occurred,
and is even now happening, in Europe. But the
surviving European languages are mostly sturdy and
vigorous, and do not readily yield place to one another.
In India the process of linguistic invasion is
going on before our eyes, attendant on the gradual
growth of Hindu civilisation and religion, which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">{4}</a></span>
disdains to practise open and reasoned proselytism,
but extends its borders nevertheless, and carries with
it one or another of the Aryan dialects.</p>

<p>In spite of the spread of the stronger languages,
the five great families of Indian speech remain and
testify to more varied origins than those of Europe.
One of the first results of familiarity with Indian
peoples is a sense of their remarkable variety of
aspect and culture. When the stranger lands in
India, his first feeling is one of bewildering sameness;
the dusky beings that surround him seem as like one
another as sheep, or peas. But that sensation is
merely due to the predominance of unfamiliar colour,
and soon gives way to an impression of astonishing
and most interesting variety. This variety is exhibited
by the careful anthropometric investigations
of the ethnologist. But there is more variety than
average measurements show, and the rough impressions
of the experienced administrator and traveller
are not without their value. For instance, Sir William
Hunter, in his work on <i>The Indian Empire</i>, classified
the highlanders of Chota Nagpore as a race apart,
whom he called Kolārians. Sir H. H. Risley says
that "the distinction between Kolārians and Dravidians
is purely linguistic, and does not correspond
to any differences of physical type." As a matter of
average physical measurements, this criticism is just.
The average dimensions of Sonthal skulls are the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">{5}</a></span>
same as those of other Dravidian races. But he
would be a poor observer of racial characteristics,
who could not pick out a typical inhabitant of Chota
Nagpore from a crowd of southern Dravidians. Even
in parts of Bengal where such "Kolārian" folk have
settled some generations ago, and have acquired the
local language and dress, they are almost as easily
distinguished as a Hindu undergraduate in Cambridge.
If physical characters are rightly divided into "indefinite"
signs of race, which can only be described
with difficulty and hesitation in ordinary language,
and the "definite" signs which can be measured and
reduced to figures, yet the general aspect of a tribe
or caste is the first thing which strikes an experienced
enquirer's eye, and leads him to make further and
more detailed investigations.</p>

<p>So is it also with those divisions, peculiar to India,
which are known to us by the Portuguese name of
<i>caste</i>. The Indian name for caste is <i>varna</i>, or
"colour," and physical differences between different
castes were fairly obvious even before accurate
averages were struck between many individual
measurements. Caste has undoubtedly tended, and
for similar reasons, to perpetuate such differences
between classes of men as we readily recognise between
different breeds of horses or cattle. The ages
of men succeed one another more slowly than the
generations of domestic animals, and segregation, in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">{6}</a></span>
spite of caste rules, has probably at no time been so
rigid as in the case of pure-bred animals. But there
is a restriction in the matter of marriage which has
been more or less efficacious, and especially so in the
case of the higher castes, where the women are more
carefully guarded, and pride of birth influences the
future mothers of the race. In some rare instances,
castes are still racial, preserved from immixture by
much the same feeling which leads the white American
to protect his race from a mingling of Negro or Red
Indian blood. Other castes are still recognisably the
result and record of such forbidden mixtures. Sometimes
the resulting difference is so great as to be
visible in actual measurements. Often the result is
a mere peculiarity of aspect, such as enables an
expert to identify a mongrel or a crossbreed among
domesticated animals. In any case, once a caste is
formed, it is fenced in by matrimonial rules, strict in
proportion to the social status and consideration of
the group. Not only, then, are the racial origins of
modern India more various than those of Europe, but
such varieties of colour, stature, and culture as exist
tend to be perpetuated.</p>

<p>It has been said, somewhat paradoxically, that
whereas in Europe the divisions between races of
men cut perpendicularly, as it were, so as to be more
or less local and geographical, in India the separating
lines run horizontally, and represent social strata.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">{7}</a></span>
This, of course, is only partly true. The ancient
Hindu theory of caste assumes the existence of four
great divisions of Hindu humanity, extending all over
India; namely, Brāhmans or priests, Kshatriyas, or
warriors; Vaiçyas, or trading and professional folk;
and Sūdras, who are most justly and aptly to be
described as "the remainder." In all parts of Hindu
India may be found representatives of this ancient
and theoretical division of humanity, the first two
usually claiming a western origin as eagerly as some
of us claim a tincture of Norman blood. But it
would be incorrect to say that even the highest and
purest of these four divisions is of uniform race, or
anything approaching to it, all over India. A Bengali
Brāhman, for instance, can be more or less easily distinguished
from other Bengalis, if he has the typical
appearance of his caste. But he is even more easily
distinguished from Brāhmans of other Provinces.
How much of this last difference is due to mixture
of blood, how much to difference of food and climate,
it is, of course, difficult to say. But certainly caste
produces a difference of breed in addition to the
ethnical varieties of origin which differentiate the
Indian populations from those of Europe.</p>

<p>Thirdly, some clue to Indian racial differences
may be found in the religions of the peninsula. The
greatest of these is still the Indian religion <i>par excellence</i>,
the wonderful collection of varied speculations,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">{8}</a></span>
beliefs, and practices known to us as Hinduism, and
its daughter, the religion of Buddha. The latter
has spread far and wide, has subjugated Ceylon and
Burma, and is the leading religion of the Far East.
At one time, it was supposed to be entirely or nearly
extinct in India, although students had discovered
traces of its influence in the Vishnuvite sects of
Hinduism. Recent researches have shown that an
almost unaltered form of Buddhism survives in the
very bosom of Hinduism, and is practised under
Hindu names among certain castes of Bengal and
Orissa. It is to be noted that the investigations into
these survivals have been for the most part conducted
by Bengali Hindus, among whom is springing up a
school of ethnologists and comparative linguists, who
only need a better knowledge and understanding of
European methods to be invaluable aids to western
research in such matters. In Bengal, a work of
purely anthropological interest has actually been
published in the vernacular, an interesting account
of the Chakmas, a Tibeto-Burman but partly Hinduised
race on the eastern border of Bengal. Closely
akin to the lower forms of Hinduism, and often subtly
blending with them, are many Animistic religions,
most of them professed by aboriginal tribes, speaking
one or other of the aboriginal languages.</p>

<p>Islam and Christianity are, of course, imported and
proselytising religions, and yield few if any clues to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">{9}</a></span>
racial or social origins. Many Muhammadans profess
to be, and not a few are, of authentic foreign origin.
But during the seven hundred years of Muslim rule
in India, there was much intermarriage with native
races, and even more conversion. It is curious that,
as in the case of Christianity, the conversions have
been mostly among tribes and classes of the humbler
sort. These were not denied admission into Hinduism,
but they were only admitted on terms of social and
racial degradation. Islam and Christianity alike claim
to overlook the accidents of birth and status, and
hence attract those to whom Hinduism only offered a
place among the lowest ranks of its social hierarchy.
But even in the case of the religions of Christ and
Muhammad, the inveterate Indian tendency to recognise
and insist on breed and social status has asserted
itself again and again. Among Muhammadans, the
Arabic tribal names have come to be the designations
of social units which differ but little from the
endogamous castes of Hinduism, and the same tendency
is already evident among Christian converts.
There is a marked reluctance in some quarters among
ex-Hindus to intermarry with ex-Muslims, or even to
participate in sacramental Communion with them.</p>

<p>As with caste, so with religion, the divisions are
not strictly horizontal. As Christianity is not one
thing all over Europe, but has differences of creed,
ritual, and practice corresponding to racial differences,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">{10}</a></span>
so the Hinduism, and even the Muhammadanism, of
different provinces varies. There is no sharp boundary;
there are elements in common wherever we go.
But just as Dravidian temple architecture can be
easily distinguished, even by the unpractised eye,
from that of the edifices of the Gangetic plains, so
local peculiarities of belief or ritual may come to the
aid of the anthropologist, and may suggest or confirm
distinctions more easily verified and more capable of
scientific proof.</p>

<p>The study of all these matters is not without a
practical and administrative interest at the present
time. A hundred and fifty years ago, to the racial,
tribal, and caste differences, accompanied by differences
of language and religion, were added political
divisions, accentuated by frequent dynastic or predatory
wars. British rule has introduced two powerful
unifying influences. Our system of administration,
while it is adapted more or less effectively (more in
some cases, less in others, according to the talent and
character of local officers) to local precedents and
local needs, is moulded by the great supervising
and consolidating authority of the Governor-General
in Council.</p>

<p>Secondly, higher education in India is conducted
for the most part in English, and educated India,
rapidly growing in numbers, has English for its
second language, and is modifying local beliefs,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">{11}</a></span>
usages, aspirations, patriotisms in accordance with
ideas more or less consciously assimilated from European
teachers and models. No one can deny that
this new unity of India is the direct result of centralised
British rule. In the far distance of time, all or
nearly all India would, for a while, accept the domination
of some Hindu ruler or dynasty. Under the
Muhammadans, similarly, there were times when the
Emperor at Delhi was the ruler of all or nearly all
India. Under British rule, a much wider and more
populous India, ranging from Baluchistan to Burma,
and only excepting the semi-independent states which
have been allowed to retain sovereign powers, is really
and for the first time part of the greatest administration
on earth except that of China, if we look to
numbers. It is a result, as the history of British India
shows, for which we cannot claim the whole credit.
The direction of the great work of unification has
been in British hands; it has chiefly been carried
out by indigenous agency, and, in matters of detail,
in deference to Indian ideas and Indian suggestions.
Even fifty years ago, few Indians supposed that the
wide Empire of India could be governed save under
British guidance, or without the aid of British bayonets.
The old habitual forces of disruption were too obvious;
the distrust of one race for another was still too
keenly felt to allow Indian politicians to imagine
a united India under indigenous rule. But as the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">{12}</a></span>
educated classes grow in power, in numbers, in self-reliance,
and reliance on one another; as some of
them are promoted to posts of higher trust and
authority in India, and even in England, it is perhaps
only natural that Indians should suppose that, so far
as politics and administration are concerned, the old
divisions and dissensions are obsolete, and that united
India can in future be governed by native agency.
That is not a matter with which ethnology has anything
to do. It is the ethnologist's business merely
to record impartially what racial, tribal, social, and
religious differences still survive, and, if he can, to
show how far they have been, and are being, obliterated
by the spread of education, and by growing
self-confidence and ambition among educated Indians.
Whether the information the ethnologist collects can
be put to any administrative use does not concern
him, nor does he desire that his impartiality shall be
affected by these considerations. But, in a little book
of this kind it may not be amiss to point out that one
result of British rule has been the growth of a new
type of Indian, the educated Indian; who, whether he
be Hindu or Muhammadan or Buddhist, is at least
inclined to subordinate the old hereditary divisions
to common political ambitions. These ambitions
affect the fortunes and the future of some three
hundred millions of humbler Indians, at present only
linked by the accident of common British rule, and,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">{13}</a></span>
so far as they are Hindus, by a common Hindu
sentiment.</p>

 <h2>CHAPTER I<br />
 <small>RACE AND CASTE</small></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Curiously</span> enough, the systematic enquiry into
the physical race-characteristics of the Indian peoples
was due to a daring assertion by Mr Nesfield, of the
Indian Educational Service, to the effect that, so far
as physical signs go, there is practically only one
Indian race and one Indian caste. This was a hasty
but quite natural generalisation from experience of
a part of India, the United Provinces, which is in the
heart of the Aryan settlement in the Gangetic <i>do-āb</i>
(the area between "two rivers"). Here caste has
long been a settled institution, and innumerable sub-castes,
professional or the result of outcasting, have
come into existence. Mr Nesfield was driven by his
local observations to assert the unity of one great
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">{14}</a></span>
Indian race; he denied the truth of "the modern
doctrine which divides the population of India into
Aryan and aboriginal": he sturdily declared that it
was impossible to distinguish a scavenger from a
Brāhman, save by costume and other artificial and
accidental marks. Even in the United Provinces
this uncompromising statement awoke dissent. In
other parts of India, as, for instance, on the north-eastern
frontier, the crowded home of many races
and languages, dissent was eager and loud. It was
evident, on the face of it, that Mr Nesfield's new
dogma was based on too limited a study. Caste, for
him, was a mere matter of hereditary function and
profession; since most castes in the sacred "midland"
of Hinduism have assumed that guise. There is no
reason to suppose that castes have usually or even
often been formed as professional guilds. They come
into being for many reasons, some of which will be
presently stated; and in civilised communities, where
the division of labour and specialisation of professional
skill are well established, a caste gradually
assumes some distinctive means of livelihood. But
on the borders of Hinduism, where the Hindu social
system is still assimilating new races, instances abound
of racial castes, tribal castes, perhaps even (though
this is a more doubtful matter) totemistic castes.</p>

<p>Those who had the widest experience of the
Peninsula were convinced that its races were at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">{15}</a></span>
least as varied as those of Europe: those who, like
Mr Nesfield, had made a close study of one limited
tract, might have continued to believe that under the
superficial distinctions of caste and class lay a real
unity of race. But Mr (afterwards Sir H. H.) Risley
had spent the early years of his Indian service among
the Dravidian tribes of Chota Nagpore, and was
aware that they differ more widely from the people
Mr Nesfield had studied than an Englishman differs
from a Turk. The difference, indeed, was almost as
great as that between a European and a Chinaman.
Could such differences be registered and described
in such a way as to convince minds accustomed to
scientific accuracy in statement? Mr Risley thought
he saw his way to an ethnological classification of
Indian races and castes by means of the then comparatively
new methods of anthropometry. In 1891,
he published in the <i>Journal of the Anthropological
Institute</i> a paper which marked the beginning of
systematic ethnological studies in India. It contained
a summary of the measurements of eighty-nine
castes and tribes of Bengal, the United Provinces,
and Bihār. It dealt, therefore, with the great
alluvial plain, created by the Ganges and Indus,
which lies between the Himalayas and the <i>massif
central</i> of the Deccan. Here is the home of the
Aryan immigrants, where the great Indo-European
languages are spoken by communities as numerous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">{16}</a></span>
as the larger European nations. Anthropometry
showed in the plainest, the most incontrovertible
way, that the caste system of marriages had sorted
out men into classes possessing definite and recognisable
physical characteristics. There were local
differences, and caste differences. It only remained
to extend anthropometrical measurements to other
parts of India to prove that the many languages and
religious beliefs of India are associated with an even
greater variety of physical qualities. Such enquiries
are still in progress, but many notable results have
already been obtained, especially by Mr Edgar
Thurston, in his now famous investigations into
Dravidian ethnography.</p>

<p>The most important and significant measurement
is that of the shape of the head. It is, of course,
impossible to take a man at random and to say with
certainty that the excessive length or breadth of his
skull proves him to belong to a given race. But the
average skull-measurements of a race are distinctive,
and confirm, on the whole, the impressions created
by general aspect, colour, language and other vaguer
indications. The general result is as follows. At
either end of the Himalayan range, in Baluchistan
on the west, and in Assam and Burma on the east,
broad heads prevail. Broad too are the heads of the
mostly Mongolian races inhabiting the valleys of the
southern slopes of the Himalayas, and in a belt of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">{17}</a></span>
country running down the western coast at least as
far south as Coorg. In the Panjāb, Rājputānā, and
the United Provinces, tracts where the climate is dry
and healthy, where great summer heat is compensated
for by a bracing winter, where wheat is for the most
part the staple food, long heads predominate. In
Bihār, travelling eastwards, medium heads are most
common. In the damp and steamy delta of Bengal,
inhabited by over forty millions of rather dusky rice-eating
people, there is a marked tendency towards
the Mongolian brachy-cephaly of Tibeto-Burman
races. It is visible among the Muhammadans and
Chandāls of Eastern Bengal, people who are probably
indigenous in this tract, it is more marked among the
Kāyasthas, the writer-caste of Bengal, which claims
a western and Aryan origin. It reaches its maximum
development among the Bengali Brāhmans. South
of the Vindhya mountains, where the population is
chiefly Dravidian, with a comparatively small and
ancient mixture of northern blood, the prevalent
type is mainly long-headed or medium-headed. The
coast-population has been much affected by foreign
influences. On the east coast Malayan, Indo-Chinese
and even Portuguese settlers have altered the local
type. On the west coast, Arab, Persian, African,
European, and Jewish immigrants have mingled with
local races, and have changed their physiognomy,
stature, and character of mind and body.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">{18}</a></span>
It is still a moot point, which the Mendelists may
some day settle for us, whether head-form is a true
hereditary race-characteristic, whether the osseous
structure of the body generally is not a result of
climate, food and other such circumstances of environment.
Yet the shape of the head as shown by
average measurements does mark off races of men
which are separated by other differences than those
of habitat. They do correspond to those vaguer yet
unmistakeable characteristics which enable us to tell
one race from another. The Mongolian, even when
he settles in the plains of Assam, Bengal, or Burma
and takes to a diet of rice and fish, keeps his round
head and his smooth hairless face. The Aryan of the
north-west has a markedly long head, which, in his
case, goes with a fair complexion and luxuriant
beard. The Dravidian, darkest of Indian races, with
a tendency to crinkly or curly hair, has also a long or
medium head. The mixed races of Bengal have, it
is not surprising to find, medium heads, which tend
in the upper castes to become broad.</p>

<p>Another significant index to race is the measurement
of the nose. The results of nose-measurements
roughly divide the peoples of India into three classes&mdash;those
having narrow or fine noses (leptorrhine), in
which the width is less than 70 per cent. of the height;
those having medium noses (mesorrhine), with an
average index of from 70 to 85; and broad-nosed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">{19}</a></span>
(platyrrhine) people, the width of whose noses exceed
85 per cent. Here we get a physical means of distinguishing
between the long-headed people of north-western
India, fair and stalwart, and the almost
equally long-headed dusky folk of the south. For
the average nose of southern India, in Madras, the
Central Provinces, and Chota Nagpore, is broad. In
the Panjāb and Baluchistan we get fine noses of what,
to us Europeans, seems an aristocratic type. In
Afghanistan, noses are so long and hooked as to give
the tall and vigorous Afghan a Jewish aspect. In the
rest of India, and especially down the west coast,
noses are of medium type. A still more interesting
discovery is the fact that anywhere outside the Aryan
tracts of the north-west, the broad nose is a distinct
sign of aboriginal blood. In Bengal, for instance, the
lower castes have broad noses. The priestly and
writer castes, for all their broad heads, have fine
noses, which support their claim to a western origin.
Roughly speaking, the broad nose goes with primitive
forms of social organisation, with totemistic exogamous
clans. Finer noses are usually associated with
communities of a more modern type; and above these
again come social units, castes and tribes, which claim
descent from eponymous saints and heroes.</p>

<p>A third physical measurement enables us to effect
a further sorting out of Indian races. What is called
the "flatness" of the Mongolian face is plain to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">{20}</a></span>
most careless observer. This is due chiefly to the
formation of the cheekbone, and its relation to the
socket of the eye and the root of the nose. This can
be measured and expressed in figures, with the result
that the Mongoloid people of the north-east and
the Himalayan region can be definitely distinguished
from the broad-headed races of Baluchistan, Bombay,
and Coorg.</p>

<p>Finally, it is possible to arrive at the average
stature of various Indian races and communities.
The tallest races are found in the north-west, in
Baluchistan, the Panjāb and Rājputānā. A progressive
diminution is seen as we go down the valley
of the Ganges, until we find very short folk among
the Assam hill tribes. The Dravidians of the south
are shorter than the Aryans of the north. The
smallest Indian tribe is that of the Negritos of the
Andaman Islands, whose average height is only 4 feet
10½ inches.</p>

<p>From a careful comparison of these measurements,
Sir Herbert Risley arrived at the classification of
Indian humanity, which, for the moment, is the
accepted division, into seven main physical types.
Beginning with the north-western frontier, these are
as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>(1) The <i>Turko-Iranian</i> type, which comprises
the Baloches, Brāhuis and Afghans of Baluchistan
and the north-west Frontier Province. These are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">{21}</a></span>
probably the result of a fusion of Turkī and Persian
blood, and are all Muhammadans. The general aspect
is wholly different from that of other Indian races,
and no one who has ever seen an Afghan or Baloch,
with his long Jewish nose and plentiful hair and
beard, can ever confuse this type with any other.
In temperament also these men of the border differ
from other Indians. They are a fierce and warlike
race, engaged in constant blood-feuds with one another.</p>

<p>(2) The <i>Indo-Aryan</i> type, with its home in the
Panjāb, Rājputānā and Kashmir, has as its most
conspicuous members the Rājputs, Khattris and Jāts.
These, in all but colour (and even in colour they are
hardly more dusky than the races round the Mediterranean)
closely resemble the well-bred European in
type. In stature they are tall, their complexion is
fair; "eyes dark; hair on face plentiful; head long;
nose narrow and prominent, but not specially long."
One significant peculiarity of this group is that there
is little difference in physical character between the
upper and lower classes. This, as we shall presently
see, is what we should expect from what is known of
the history of these peoples. The upper social ranks
probably represent the blood, but little diluted with
indigenous mixture, of the Aryan immigrants. Even
in the lower classes, the typical Aryan characteristics
are now so prominent that any indigenous strain that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">{22}</a></span>
exists is no longer noticeable in average measurements.
Only in height, a quality especially sensitive
to differences of food and sanitation, are the lower
castes inferior. Here we get a remarkable modern
instance of transformation of type. The preaching
of the Sikh reformers, involving a change of food
and the inculcation of martial discipline and fervour,
has converted the despised scavenging Chuhrā into
the soldierly Mazhabi, once a redoubtable foe of the
English, and now one of the finest soldiers in the
British army.</p>

<p>(3) The <i>Scytho-Dravidian</i> type, including the
Marāthā Brāhmans, the Kunbīs, and the Coorgs of
western India. These peoples differ from the Turko-Iranian
races in being shorter, in having longer heads,
higher noses, and flatter faces.</p>

<p>(4) The <i>Aryo-Dravidian</i> or Hindostāni type,
which exists in the United Provinces, in parts of
Rājputānā, and in Bihār. This type appears to be
due to a mixture of Indo-Aryan and Dravidian
strains. The higher classes resemble Indo-Aryans,
the lower have a distinctly Dravidian aspect. Yet,
even to the eye, they form a type apart and are easily
recognised. In this type, the average nose-index
corresponds exactly to social status. The noses grow
broader as we go downwards in the social scale.</p>

<p>(5) The very interesting <i>Mongolo-Dravidian</i> or
<i>Bengali</i> type which is found in Bengal and Orissa.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">{23}</a></span>
Here Aryan influences may still be detected in the
upper classes, but there has been extensive mingling
with Tibeto-Burman and Dravidian peoples, and other
aboriginal inhabitants. The main distinguishing
feature is the broad head, which is most conspicuous
in the upper classes. It is shared equally by the
Bengali Brāhman, who claims a western origin, and
the Chittagong Mag, whose Tibeto-Burman origin
is not denied. The Brāhman, on the other hand,
inherits a fine and narrow nose, which may very well
be due to Indo-Aryan ancestry. Recent investigations
tend to show that Buddhism survived till a
comparatively recent date in Bengal. Hence, no
doubt, a temporary disregard of caste restrictions
and a freer mixture with local strains.</p>

<p>(6) The <i>Mongoloid</i> type of the Himalayas, Nepāl,
Assam, and Burma. "The head is broad: complexion
dark, with a yellowish tinge; hair on face scanty;
stature short or below average; nose fine to broad;
face characteristically flat; eyelids often oblique."
Here we have races which, if somewhat dark, correspond
to the ideas most of us entertain about the
external aspect and temperament of the Siamese or
Japanese. In intellectual ability, and what we may
call the artistic faculty, they are inferior to the
Bengali. Most Europeans, however (or is it, therefore?)
find them among the most congenial of Indian
races. They are social, good-natured, straightforward
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">{24}</a></span>
people. In the western Himalayas, there has been
intermixture with Aryan invaders, as in the Kangra
Valley and Nepāl, and the ruling dynasties claim
Rājput origin, for the Indo-Aryans loved to settle
in the cool hills, much as the Anglo-Indian does to
this day. But on the mountainous frontiers of North-East
Bengal and Assam, the Mongoloid peoples have
remained undisturbed till our own time. Linguistically,
this group is peculiarly interesting, since they
speak many tongues, many of which still remain to
be recorded and studied by European scholars.</p>

<p>(7) The <i>Dravidian</i> type, which extends from
Ceylon to the valley of the Ganges and covers all
South-Eastern India. It is found in Madras, Hyderabad,
the Central Provinces, most of Central India,
and Chota Nagpore. Its purest representatives dwell
on the Malabar coast and in Chota Nagpore. Here
we have probably the original inhabitants of India,
now modified in some degree by an infiltration of
Aryan, Scythian and Mongoloid elements. "The
stature is short or below mean; the complexion very
dark, approaching black; hair plentiful, with an
occasional tendency to curl; eyes dark; head long;
nose very broad, sometimes depressed at the root,
but not so as to make the face appear flat."</p>

<p>It must, of course, be understood, that these types
and the names allotted to them merely show that in
certain areas the average characteristics of the peoples
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">{25}</a></span>
dwelling there can be sufficiently separated to be
recognisable not only by eye but by the callipers of
the anthropologist. The names, it will be noticed,
in some cases, imply theories as to the origin of the
races thus grouped together. These theories are
partly based on measurements, partly on tradition,
partly on linguistic considerations. It remains for
me to state, very rapidly, what these theories are.</p>

<p>That the Dravidians are the oldest race in India
is rendered <i>primâ facie</i> probable by the fact that
they inhabit the southernmost part of the peninsula,
between races who can with some certainty be called
invaders&mdash;and the deep sea. There is a remarkable
uniformity of physical characteristics among the lower
specimens of this type. They have in common an
animistic religion, their distinctive language, their
peculiar stone monuments, and a primitive system
of totemism. They do not resemble Europeans on
the one hand, or the races of the Far East on the
other. Until proof to the contrary is forthcoming
they may well be regarded as the autochthones of
India.</p>

<p>There is more room for difference of opinion as to
the origins of the brilliant and highly civilised Indo-Aryans
of the Panjāb and Rājputānā. As I have said
before, we have here a population closely resembling
that of modern Europe in many respects. I might
have added that it still more closely resembles the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">{26}</a></span>
Europe of the Roman empire. Nowhere else in
Hindu India does caste sit so lightly, or approach
so nearly to the social classes of Europe. Though
there are rules, or rather customs, forbidding intermarriage
between different castes, yet these are
mitigated by the custom, not unknown to ourselves,
of <i>hypergamy</i>. This simply means that a man may
take a wife from a lower caste, but will not give his
daughters to men of that caste. The result is a
uniformity of physical type found nowhere else in
India. Moreover these people speak a language of
the Indo-European family, and have many words and
idioms in common with ourselves. The present theory
of their origin is simply that they are in the bulk
immigrants into India, immigrants who came into
the land from the north-west with their herds and
families, as the Jews entered into and possessed
Palestine.</p>

<p>One chief objection to this theory is that the
lands through which they must have passed are in
no way fitted to be an <i>officina gentium</i>, being now
dry, barren, and all but deserted. But abundant
indications remain to show that the climate of South-Eastern
Persia and the tracts to the north has
changed within comparatively recent times. The
relics of crowded populations and ancient civilisations
abound in regions now sandy desert, and there
is evidence in the tales told by Greek and Chinese
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">{27}</a></span>
travellers that the Panjāb itself, most of it comparatively
arid, was once well wooded. The theory
then is that the homogeneous and handsome population
of the Panjāb and Rājputānā represents the
almost pure descendants of Aryan settlers, who
carried the Indo-European languages now prevailing
over Northern India, just as our own emigrants took
the English language to America.</p>

<p>But we have also to account for the Aryo-Dravidians
who inhabit the sacred "midland" country
of Hinduism, and here we have Dr Hoernle's now
famous theory, remarkably confirmed by the researches
of Sir George Grierson's <i>Linguistic Survey</i>.
This theory supposes that a second swarm of Aryan-speaking
people, perhaps driven forward by the
change of climate in central Asia, entered India
through the high and difficult passes of Gilgit and
Chitral, and established themselves in the fertile
plains between the Ganges and the Jumna. They
followed a route which made it impossible for their
women to accompany them. They took to themselves
wives from the daughters of dusky Dravidian aborigines.
Here, by contact with a different, and in
their sentiment, inferior race, caste came into being.
Here most of the Vedic hymns were composed. Here,
by a blending of imported and indigenous religious
ideals, the ritual and usages of Hindu religion came
into being, to spread in altered forms east and west
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">{28}</a></span>
and south. The necessity for this second hypothesis is
twofold. It accounts for the marked ethnical barrier
which separates western from eastern Hindustan.
Elsewhere the various types melt imperceptibly into
one another. Here alone is a definite racial border
line. Again, the theory accounts for the fact that
the Vedic hymns contain no description whatever of
the earlier Aryan migration, and for the fact that the
inhabitants of the middle land always felt a dislike
for the early immigrants as men of low culture and
barbarous manners. For the present, at all events,
and perhaps for all time, Dr Hoernle's ingenious
theory holds the field.</p>

<p>No special theory is required to account for the
physical and mental qualities of the Mongolo-Dravidians
of Bengal. No doubt the original population
was Dravidian with a strong intermixture of Tibeto-Burmese
blood, especially in the east and north-east.
But the Hindu religion, developed in the sacred
Midlands round Benares, spread to Bengal, bringing
with it the Indo-European speech which in medieval
times became the copious and supple Bengali tongue.
From the west too came what we in Europe would
call the gentry, the priestly and professional castes.
These have acquired most of the local physical
characters, dusky skin, low stature, round heads.
But in nearly all cases, the fineness and sharp outline
of the nose shows their aristocratic origin, and in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">{29}</a></span>
some instances a Bengali Brāhman has all the physical
distinction of a western priest or sage.</p>

<p>When we turn to the Scytho-Dravidian group we
have again to fall back on records of ancient invasions
from the north. Ancient some of them were, but far
less ancient than the settlement of the Aryans in the
north-west. The Sakas have provided India with
one of its many chronological eras; they founded
dynasties which have left coins behind them, they
have left vague but widely spread traditions. They
were what we Europeans call Scythians. They were
known to the Persians, the Parthians, and the Chinese.
Their original home seems to have been in the south
of China, a land of pre-eminently round-headed races.
We know that they established their dominion over
portions of the Panjāb, Sind, Gujarāt, Rājputānā and
Central India. If they have left traces of their
settlement on their descendants we may reasonably
expect to find round-headed races and tribes in
regions mostly surrounded by long-headed peoples.
Such a zone of broad-headed people does in fact
extend from the western Panjāb right through the
Deccan, till it finally ends in Coorg. Sir H. H.
Risley's theory is that the Scythians first occupied
the great grazing country of the western Panjāb, and
finding their progress eastwards blocked by the Indo-Aryans,
turned southwards, mingled with the Dravidians,
and became the ancestors of the warlike
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">{30}</a></span>
Marātha race. Such an origin forms a tempting
explanation of the well-known predatory habits of
the Marātha hordes, and of their frequent raids all
over the peninsula under the decaying administration
of the later Mogul Emperors. It is an interesting
and fascinating speculation, since it accounts not
only for the physical aspect of the Marāthas but
for their characteristic political genius, for their
wide-ranging forays, their guerilla warfare, their unscrupulous
dealings, their inveterate love of intrigue,
their clannish habits.</p>

<p>I must here boldly borrow Sir H. H. Risley's
summary of the historical record of Scythian invasions
into India, since that is the main justification
for his theory. "In the time of the Achaemenian
kings of Persia," he says, "the Scythians, who were
known to the Chinese as Sse, occupied the regions
lying between the lower course of the Sillis or
Jaxartes and Lake Balkash. The fragments of early
Scythian history which may be collected from classical
writers are supplemented by the Chinese annals,
which tell us how the Sse, originally located in
southern China, occupied Sogdiana and Trans-oxiana
at the time of the establishment of the Graeco-Bactrian
monarchy. Dislodged from these regions
by the Yueh-chi, who had themselves been put to
flight by the Huns, the Sse invaded Bactriana, an
enterprise in which they were frequently allied with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">{31}</a></span>
the Parthians. To this circumstance, Ujfalvy says
may be due the resemblance which exists between
the Scythian coins of India and those of the Parthian
kings. At a later period, the Yueh-chi made a further
advance, and drove the Sse or Sakas out of Bactriana,
whereupon the latter crossed the Paropamisus and
took possession of the country called after them
Sakastān, comprising Segistān, Arachosia, and Drangiana.
But they were left in possession only for a
hundred years, for about 25 <small>B.C.</small> the Yueh-chi disturbed
them afresh. A body of Scythians then
emigrated eastwards, and founded a kingdom in the
western portion of the Panjāb. The route they
followed in their advance upon India is uncertain;
but to a people of their habits it would seem that a
march through Baluchistan would have presented no
serious difficulties.</p>

<p>"The Yueh-chi, afterwards known as the Tokhari,
were a power in Central Asia and the north-west of
India for more than five centuries, from 130 <small>B.C.</small> The
Hindus called them Sakas and Turushkas, but their
kings seem to have known no other dynastic title
than that of Kushan. The Chinese annals tell us
how Kitolo, chief of the Little Kushans, whose name
is identified with the Kidara of the coins, giving way
before the incursion of the Ephthalites, crossed the
Paropamisus, and founded, in the year 425 of our
era, the kingdom of Gandhāra, of which, in the time
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">{32}</a></span>
of his son, Peshawar became the capital. About
the same time, the Ephthalites or Ye-tha-i-li-to of
the Chinese annals, driven out of their territory by the
Yuan-yuan, started westward, and overran in succession
Sogdiana, Khwarizan (Khiva), Bactriana, and
finally the north-west portion of India. Their movements
reached India in the reign of Skanda Gupta
(452-80) and brought about the disruption of the
Gupta empire. The Ephthalites were known in India
as Huns. The leader of the invasion of India, who
succeeded in snatching Gandhāra from the Kushans
and established his capital at Sākala, is called by the
Chinese Laelih, and inscriptions enable us to identify
him with the original Lakhan Udayāditya of the
coins. His son Toramāna (490-515) took possession
of Gujarāt, Rājputānā, and part of the Ganges valley,
and in this way the Huns acquired a portion of
the ancient Gupta kingdom. Toramāna's successor,
Mihirakula (515-44), eventually succumbed to the
combined attack of the Hindu princes of Mālwā and
Magadha."</p>

<p>I now come to the ethnography as distinguished
from the ethnology of India. Of anthropometry and
the lessons to be learnt from it, I have no personal
experience, and have had to borrow my materials at
second-hand. But with the great system of caste, its
workings, its manifold ramifications, everyone who
has lived in India has come into more or less close
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">{33}</a></span>
contact. How important caste is in the social life
of the country may be easily inferred from this little
fact. I once asked the late Navin Chandra Sen, then
the most popular of Bengali poets, if he would attempt
a definition of what a Hindu is. After many suggestions,
all of which had to be abandoned on closer
examination, the poet came to the conclusion that a
Hindu is (1) one who is born in India of Indian
parents on both sides, and (2) accepts and obeys the
rules of caste. Hinduism is, roughly speaking, the
religion of the Aryo-Dravidians, the upper and fairer
classes among whom regarded the aborigines, matrimonially,
much as white Americans regard their negro
fellow citizens. It has spread over nearly the whole
of India and is still spreading, usually but not always,
carrying with it one of the Indo-European languages
of India. It is the religion and social system of races
and classes which consider themselves intrinsically
superior, and practise a traditional kind of eugenics,
of race preservation. Humbler or more barbarous
races are admitted on various conditions into caste,
sometimes into higher, sometimes into lower positions.
The process is one of that kind of "legal fiction"
with which students of Roman law are familiar. It
is a process of unification and, at the same time, of
social segregation. I have already alluded to the
suggestion that caste-divisions are horizontal, as it
were, compared with the geographical divisions of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">{34}</a></span>
races. But it is always dangerous to make general
statements about three hundred millions of people
scattered over so large an area as India. There are
Brāhmans in every part of India, and these usually
trace their origin back to the sacred midland where
Hinduism came into being. They may be, and probably
are, the descendants of the missionaries by
whom the religion of the Hindus is, imperceptibly
and without open proselytism, spread abroad. Something
corresponding to a warrior caste and a caste of
scribes is to be found in most provinces, and many
of these either claim to be migrants, or have been
admitted by adoption into the privileges of warrior
or writer blood.</p>

<p>But there are many castes which are purely local,
even in name, and are not found elsewhere than in
the places where they were admitted into the Hindu
community. Many closely printed pages in the
Census Reports of each province and state enumerate
and describe the thousands of castes revealed by the
numbering of the people. It is, of course, only
possible to give a very vague and general idea of
some of the classes into which the castes of India
may conveniently be divided.</p>

<p>I am tempted here to borrow Sir Herbert Risley's
definition of caste. But it is a highly abstract definition,
and one that cannot be easily carried in the
head, even by those who have a practical and familiar
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">{35}</a></span>
acquaintance with members of Indian castes. Roughly
a caste is a group of human beings who may not
intermarry, or (usually) eat, with members of any
other caste. There are also sub-castes which are
also endogamous. Very frequently, especially in the
parts of India where caste is already an institution
of immemorial antiquity, a caste has allotted to it a
profession or occupation.</p>

<p>Before we discuss castes properly so called, it is
convenient to speak of the tribes of India, since tribes
have a tendency to become castes when they come
under the pervasive influence of Hindu social ideas.
In the south of India are Dravidian tribes, of which
the best example are the tribes of Chota Nagpore.
These are divided into a number of exogamous
groups or clans, calling themselves by the name of
an animal or plant, which may be regarded as their
totem. The Khonds of Orissa, who once bore an evil
name for their practice of human sacrifices to propitiate
the earth-goddess, are divided into fifty <i>gochis</i>
or exogamous clans, each of which bears the name of
a village, and believes itself to be descended from a
common ancestor. These <i>gochis</i> are the nearest
known approach to the local exogamous tribe which
Mr McLennan and the French sociologists believe to
be the earliest form of human society.</p>

<p>The Mongoloid tribes of Assam are much of
the same kind, but in many cases, as among the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">{36}</a></span>
head-hunting Nagas, live at perpetual warfare with
one another. In such cases they usually capture their
wives in war. It is interesting to note that when
population grows too dense for the profitable pursuit
of the chase, their principal means of livelihood, such
a tribe breaks up into two or more "villages," which
immediately begin waging war with one another,
which is quite what a French sociologist would expect
them to do. I can tell of a case within my own
experience in which the headman of a parent village
invited the chief of a colony village (his own nephew)
to a feast and palaver with his young warriors. The
guests were all treacherously put to the sword, as a
means of acquiring heads and concubines. I could
not get the headman to see that he had been guilty
of an atrocious crime. For him, it was lawful strategy.
And indeed Naga warfare is merely a series of artfully
planned ambushes in which not a few of our own
officers perished before we undertook the direct
administration of the Naga Hills. Sir H. Risley
remarks of this group of tribes that "no very clear
traces of totemism have been discovered among them."
Subsequent enquiries, however, show that totemistic
clans do exist in some of the Assam tribes.</p>

<p>Of the Turko-Iranian tribes of the north-western
frontier I need not speak at any length, since these
tribes are all sturdy followers of the Prophet, and
save that they are under British rule can hardly be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">{37}</a></span>
said to belong to India at all. There is no likelihood
that they will ever be received into the tolerant bosom
of Hinduism, since, to the Indian proper, the Baloch and
the Afghan are disagreeable and swaggering caterans,
who have an innate scorn for the typical Hindu hierarchy
of caste. Among these tribes it is martial ability
and valour that win a man consideration and wives.</p>

<p>Let us now turn to caste properly so called, the
traditional social divisions of the Hindus. And first it is
necessary to say something of the ancient Hindu theory
of what caste is, and how it came into existence.</p>

<p>As with the Hebrews, the religious literature of
India contains a vast mass of what can only be called
law, and perhaps, the most famous of Indian law books
is the Institutes of Manu, a compilation of rules
relating to magic, religion, law, custom, ritual and
metaphysics. Even to this day, these branches of
speculation and enquiry, so distinct to western imaginations,
are apt to be confused together as a result of
the pantheistic feeling which pervades Hinduism.
The Institutes is a comparatively modern book, but
it repeats ideas which are found in a more or less
explicit form in early authorities<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_1" id="Ref_1" href="#Foot_1">[1]</a></span>.
In this book we are told that in the beginning of things the Pan-theos
who "contains all created things and is inconceivable"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">{38}</a></span>
produced by effort of thought a golden egg, from
which he himself was born as Brahmā, the creator of
the known universe. From his mouth, his arms,
his thighs, and his feet respectively he created the
four great leading castes, the Brāhman, the Kshatriya,
the Vaiçya, and the Sūdra. These were, briefly, the
priests, the warriors and gentlefolk, the traders, and
the servile classes of human society. The other castes
were gradually formed, the theory states, by intermarriages
between these. The three higher castes were
allowed to take wives from lower castes. When the
caste of the mother was next below that of the father,
the child took the caste of his mother and no new caste
was formed. But where the difference of condition
was greater than this, new castes were formed, lower
than those of either parent. Some discrepancies of
rank produced unions which were regarded as peculiarly
offensive to human feelings and as tantamount
to incestuous intercourse. These resulted in very
degraded castes. Where the father married beneath
him, the marriage was described as <i>anuloma</i> or "with
the hair." When a woman was guilty of a <i>mésalliance</i>,
the marriage was called <i>pratiloma</i> or "against
the hair." The most disgraceful union of this kind
was that between a Brāhman woman and a Sūdra
man, the resulting offspring being relegated to the
caste of Chandāl. The unfortunate Chandāl is described
as "that lowest of mortals," and is condemned,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">{39}</a></span>
as Sir H. Risley says, to live outside the village, to
clothe himself in the garments of the dead, to eat
from broken dishes, to execute criminals, and to carry
out the corpses of friendless men.</p>

<p>The most superficial acquaintance with existing
caste divisions shows that this theory is not so much
a hypothesis as a fanciful fiction. In eastern Bengal,
for instance, the Chandāl is evidently a Mongoloid
aboriginal, with a considerable strain of Dravidian
and perhaps even of Aryan blood. Yet the fiction
shows plainly enough the estimation in which one of
the numerically largest divisions of local society is
held. Some thirty years ago, when I was a young
magistrate, a comely Chandāl girl appeared before
me, her face streaming with blood from a scalp
wound. She asserted gravely that a Sūdra of higher
caste had struck her on the head with a stick, because
he had found her reading a book as she sat in the
doorway of her father's cottage. I was disinclined
to believe this story, but her assailant was promptly
sent for, and being brought straight to me, admitted
the truth of the charge, and seemed surprised at my
indignation at a cowardly assault.</p>

<p>As an attempt to account for the origin and
explain the nature of caste the theory of Manu is
obviously a failure. But it contains a picture of the
early castes. It is also interesting because the idea
of four original <i>varnas</i> or "colours" of men may have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">{40}</a></span>
been borrowed from the old Persian social organisation.
The early scriptures, the Vedas, show that this
conception of four original castes was not brought to
India by Aryan immigrants. But when caste came
into being as a result of the contact of Aryan settlers
with Dravidian aborigines, this mythological explanation,
which gave such conspicuous eminence to
priests and warriors, an eminence already conceded
to them on account of the importance of their functions,
was readily accepted as a convincing explanation
of the hereditary differences between men in society,
a difference not merely of function, but of colour,
aspect, gesture, speech, breeding, and intelligence.
It is necessary to mention this theory, however briefly,
since it still holds ground, except among those
Indians who have had a European education and
even among them has the interest of early and
sacred associations which, in Europe, belongs to the
cosmological speculations of the book of Genesis.</p>

<p>What, next, are castes as they appear to the eye
of the European ethnologist, free from preconceived
prejudice, and only anxious to come as near the
truth as is possible in his dealings with ancient
institutions round which has gathered a vast mass
of venerable superstition and religious speculation?
In the first place, castes are often still recognisably
<i>tribes</i>. Sometimes the leading men of an aboriginal
tribe will acquire sufficient wealth and social
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">{41}</a></span>
consideration to wish to obtain the stamp of recognition
as reputable Hindus. They will call themselves,
for example, and induce their neighbours and the
priests of these to call them, Rājputs. They may not at
first succeed in intermarrying with true hereditary
Rājputs, but in time they will be just Rājputs like any
other Rājputs. Or, again, a number of non-Hindus,
animists, will join one of the many Hindu sects or fraternities
and will intermarry with Vaishnavas, Lingayats,
Rāmayats, or other devotees of some favourite deity.
Or again, a whole tribe or a considerable portion
of a tribe, usually one of some political importance,
will enter Hinduism by means of some plausible
fiction. The instance quoted by Sir H. Risley is that
of the Koches of north-eastern Bengal. These people
are Tibeto-Burmans and until recent times spoke a
dialect of the agglutinative Bodo language. They
now call themselves Rājbansis, "of royal birth," or
Bhāngā Kshatriyas, "broken warriors," names which
enable them to claim an origin from the traditional
dispersion of the Aryan warrior caste by the hero
Parasu Rāma, "Rāma of the battle axe." They
claim descent from the epic monarch Dasarath, father
of Rāma, have their own Brāahmins, and have begun
to adopt the Brāhminical system of exogamous
<i>gotras</i>. But, as Sir H. Risley remarks, they are in
a transitional state, since they have all hit upon the
same <i>gotra</i>, and are therefore compelled to marry
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">{42}</a></span>
within it, except in the rare instances in which they
contract unions with Bengali women.</p>

<p>A still more interesting, because more recent,
instance of this sort is that of the Meithei, now
known to Hindus as Manipuris. In the Mahābhāarata
is told the tale of how the hero Arjuna wandered
from his brethren into Southern and Eastern India,
and, among other adventures, met (as Æneas with
Dido) with Chitrangadā, the fair daughter of the
King of Manipur, somewhere near the eastern coast.
Some 150 years ago, the then king of the beautiful
valley of Imphāl, between Assam and Burma, was
thinking of becoming a Muhammadan, by way of
courting the favour of the Muhammadan rulers of
Bengal. But Hindu priests persuaded him that
a better way of linking his fortunes with those of
India, rather than with Ava (with whose royal family
his dynasty had usually intermarried), was by becoming
Hindu with all his people. Imphāl was
identified with Manipur, and many of the Meithei
race became Vishnuvite Hindus with their ruler,
though they retain their primitive Tibeto-Burman
language. I may mention a little personal reminiscence
to show how completely the change by fictitious
adoption was accepted in Bengal. In 1891, my old
friend and chief, Mr Quinton, with all his staff, was
treacherously murdered at Manipur. Subsequently
when I was magistrate of Chittagong, I found that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">{43}</a></span>
my head clerk, an extremely mild and intelligent
Bengali Kāyastha, had celebrated the easily suppressed
mutiny at Manipur by writing a drama
based on the ancient legend of Arjuna's amours
with Chitrangadā!</p>

<p>Sometimes an aboriginal tribe will become a
Hindu caste without losing its old tribal designation.
They will worship Hindu gods without daring wholly
to neglect tribal deities, which, as might perhaps be
expected, are left chiefly to the women of the tribe.
Such a tribe will rapidly assimilate itself to the
beliefs and practices of Hindu neighbours, and
finally only its name and (except in case of occasional
intermarriage with other castes) its physical aspect
will remain to testify to its origin.</p>

<p>Castes are at present classified as follows:</p>

<p>(1) What Sir H. Risley calls <i>the tribal type</i>,
instances of which have been given above. Such
tribal castes abound in all parts of India. It is not
improbable that the great Sūdra division of Hindu
tradition was originally the whole mass of Dravidian
aboriginals as they came into contact with Aryan
immigrants, and were conceded a subordinate place
in their social system. It would be useless to give
a list of the names of such castes, but I cannot
refrain from mentioning the excellent Doms of the
Assam Valley, whose name unfortunately associates
them with very different people in India proper.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">{44}</a></span>
They are obviously of Tibeto-Burman origin, and
deserve closer study than they receive. Their long
thatched places of worship, true synagogues for
meeting together and curiously unlike the tiny <i>cellæ</i>
of Hindu temples, are among the most conspicuous
features of Assam villages. They have no idols, and
place a <i>puthi</i>, a holy book, on what may pass for the
village altar. They are vaguely Hinduised, but will
humbly declare "<i>āmi hindu na hô</i>," "we are not
Hindu folk." Yet they are well on their way towards
acceptance into caste, and have already a strong
infusion of Hindu blood.</p>

<p>Other border races, though they are still too
savage and independent to become Hindu, are
marked down for absorption. Such, for instance,
are the Daflas of the northern border of Assam,
cousins of the Abors to whom attention has been
drawn by recent events. The Daflas are still frankly
animistic; their love of strong spirits and other
intoxicants, their addiction to their favourite diet
of roast pork, their extremely uncleanly habits and
barbarous speech, all make them very offensive to
the gentle vegetarian Hindus their neighbours. But
it happens that the tribal costume closely resembles
the traditional dress of Mahādēva, the Destroyer, the
most active and formidable member of the Hindu
Trinity, and already some Hindus speak of these
genial Highlanders as Siva-bansa, as "of Siva's race."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">{45}</a></span>
Many other examples, with interesting details of
fictional methods, will be found in Mr E. A. Gait's
admirable <i>History of Assam</i>.</p>

<p>(2) <i>The functional or occupational type</i> of caste.
This is the form of caste best known to Europeans,
because, since the first European missionaries and
traders visited those parts of India where the caste
system has had the longest opportunity to evolve,
they came most into contact with this, which is
probably the oldest and most elaborated form of
caste. The Hindu theory of caste encouraged the
adoption of special occupations, and now the evolution
has proceeded so far that change of occupation
may usually result in a change of caste. A remarkable
instance of this is found in the Marāthi districts
of the Central Provinces. Here is a separate and
newly formed caste of village servants called Gārpagāri,
"hail-averters," whose business it is to protect
the village crops from hailstorms. Shepherds who
take to tillage break away from their pastoral
brethren, and so on. Even those who retain their
traditional occupations are wont to adopt more
seemly-sounding names than those that belong to
their trade. I have known barbers who called
themselves Chandra-vaidyas<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_2" id="Ref_2" href="#Foot_2">[2]</a></span>,
which is a promotion
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">{46}</a></span>
more subtle than a mere ascent to the status of
"hair-dresser," and washermen who have followed
suit by dubbing themselves Sukla-vaidya, a word
of which "white-worker" is a crude but sufficiently
suggestive translation.</p>

<p>(3) The <i>sectarian type</i> is a singularly interesting
example of the strong social influence of Hindu
sentiment. Nearly all new Hindu sects begin by
renouncing caste in the enthusiastic following of
some single deity, some new explanation of the
mysteries of life, and love, and death. These sects
are usually the followers of some reforming theorist,
whose leadership is apt to become hereditary. Such
sects almost always believe that all men are equal,
or at all events, that all who accept their doctrines
are equal. One of my most interesting recollections
is of a now distant interview with a buxom middle-aged
lady, the hereditary leader of the Kartā-bhajās
of Central Bengal. She sat unveiled, and was
accessible to all who, like myself, were interested
in the community over which she exercised a firm
but good-natured control. It is a picturesque detail
that her chosen seat when receiving visitors was
an ancient European four-poster bedstead. Her
followers (and revenues) were growing rapidly, increased
chiefly by the democratic instinct which,
even in India, revolts against social prestige. But
it would seem that when such a sect grows and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">{47}</a></span>
spreads, the old separatist ideas reassert themselves,
and the sect breaks up into smaller endogamous
communities, whose status depends on the original
position of the members in Hinduism. The most
remarkable instance of this kind is furnished by
the great Lingayat caste of Bombay, which contains
over two and a half millions of members. In the
twelfth century the Lingayats were a sect who
believed in the equality of all men. In Mr P. J.
Mead's Bombay Census Report for 1911 is a very
interesting account of the present condition of the
Lingayats, an account which shows how the scholar,
the linguist, and the administrator can work together
to find materials for the anthropologist. Dr Fleet's
examination of ancient inscriptions has thrown much
light on the origin of the sect, but the author of the
Report holds that there may be some reason to think
that the sect is much older than is commonly supposed.
In any case, they are already divided into
three great groups, comprising many subdivisions.</p>

<p>(4) <i>Castes formed by crossing</i> come aptly to
show that there was some basis for Manu's theory
of caste after all. Castes, nowadays, increase by
fission, by throwing off sub-castes, and one species
of these sub-castes is created by mixed marriages.
This tendency, curiously enough, is most evident
in Dravidian tribes, such as the Mundās, which
are not yet wholly Hinduised, but have been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">{48}</a></span>
affected by Hindu example. So far as I know,
these mixed castes do not occur among the Mongoloid
peoples, and I have come across cases where
a member of an aboriginal tribe has been accepted
into the caste of a Hindu girl he has married. In
one case, within my own experience, the bridegroom
had begun as an animist, had become Christian,
and finally entered by marriage into the quite
respectable Koch caste. One interesting caste in
Bengal, that of the Shāgirdpeshas, owes its origin
to concubinage with the so-called slaves, the women
of tenants surrounding a homestead who pay their
rent in service. This, it will be observed, is a caste
of illegitimacy, in which the relationship between
the legitimate and illegitimate children of a man
of good caste is recognised, but the two are not
allowed to eat together. The classical instance of
a mixed caste is the Khas of Nepāl, said to be
the result of very ancient intermarriages between
Rājput or Brāhman immigrants and the Mongolian
"daughters of men."</p>

<p>(5) <i>Castes of the national type.</i> This somewhat
daring title we owe to the great authority of Sir H.
Risley. As one instance, he mentions the Newārs,
a Mongoloid people, who were once the ruling race
in Nepāl, till the Gurkha invasion in 1769, and have
now become a caste. Other instances might be
found on the north-eastern frontier. But the people
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">{49}</a></span>
Sir Herbert Risley had in mind when he invented
this term was undoubtedly the remarkable Marātha
race, once the most daring warriors and freebooters
in India, and now the rivals of the Bengalis in intellectual
ability, and probably more than their
equals in political sagacity. Sir Rāmkrishna Gopāl
Bhandārkar is our authority for the statement that
the Rattas were a tribe who held political supremacy
in the Deccan from the earliest days. In time they
became Mahā-rattas, "Great Rattas," and the land
in which they lived was called Mahārattha, which,
by a common linguistic habit of mankind, was
Sanskritised into Mahā-rāshtra. Their marriage
customs show marked traces of totemistic institutions.
An extremely interesting account of the
present condition of this warlike and enterprising
race will be found at pp. 289, 290 of the Bombay
Census Report for 1911. It neither supports nor
discourages Sir H. Risley's ingenious theory of the
Scythic origin of the Marāthas, which is at least
a theory which recognises the respect in which our
ancestors held their martial prowess and talents<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_3" id="Ref_3" href="#Foot_3">[3]</a></span>.</p>

<p>(6) <i>Castes formed by migration.</i> These are new
castes which serve to enforce the warning against
a too ready acceptance of the definition of caste as
a "horizontal" division of humanity. It is a method
of forming new communities of Hindus which is very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">{50}</a></span>
easily intelligible to us, seeing that our own race
is split into sections only differing from castes in
not being strictly endogamous, such as Anglo-Indians,
Australians, New Zealanders, and so forth. Members
leave home and settle among strangers. They are
assumed to have formed foreign habits, eaten strange
food, worshipped alien gods, and have a difficulty&mdash;an
expensive difficulty&mdash;in finding wives in the parent
caste. After a time they marry only among themselves,
become a sub-caste, and are often known by
some territorial name, Bārendra, Rārhi, or what not.
Such seemingly are the remarkable Nāmbudri Brāhmans
of Malabar, and the Rārhi Brāhmans of Bengal.
Sometimes change of habitat brings about loss of
rank, sometimes promotion. These are matters on
which the Census Reports now being published are
full of interesting details. But they are matters
which are not easily summarised. No doubt Mr
Gait's Report on the combined results of Census
operations in India will show the progress of castes
of this type during the last ten years.</p>

<p>(7) <i>Castes formed by changes of custom.</i> This
is a fruitful cause of new divisions of Hindu society.
It is, for the moment, more than usually operative,
owing to the spread of education, and often represents
a difference of social opinion which corresponds,
more or less closely, to Conservative and Radical
ideas among ourselves. It evidently was always a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">{51}</a></span>
cause of fissiparous tendencies. The most notable
instance is the distinction between Jāts and Rājputs,
both apparently sprung from the same stock, but
separated socially, amongst other causes, by the fact
that the former practise and the latter abjure infant
marriages.</p>

<p class="gap-above">This is a very rapid and highly summarised
account of the races and castes of India. There
are many obvious omissions. Nothing has been said
of the Sikhs, little or nothing about the numerous
races of the north-eastern frontier. But enough has
been said to give a fair general impression of what
the physical characters of the Indian peoples are,
and what kind of institution caste is in its practical
working. More might have been said about totemistic
clans, but on this subject those who would
pursue their studies further have only to turn to
Dr J. G. Frazer's work on the subject. In the next
chapter, I have to borrow my materials from Sir
G. A. Grierson, and show how the peoples of India
are divided by differences of language. On the
whole, those linguistic divisions correspond with
remarkable accuracy to the orographical and climatic
structure of the country and the racial divisions
which we owe to the learning and ingenuity of Sir
H. H. Risley. Where there are great open plains,
watered and fertilised by mighty rivers, we get large
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">{52}</a></span>
populations speaking the great literary languages of
India. In the rugged recesses of the mountains we
find small communities, divided from one another by
physical obstacles which have produced rigid local
patriotisms and enmities, and a wonderful variety
of savage speeches. The linguist has usually worked
independently of the ethnologist, and has come to his
own unprejudiced conclusions. It is interesting to
find how closely the results of their separate enquiries
agree.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Postscript.</i></p>

<p>Sir H. H. Risley's theory as to the Scythian origin
of the Marāthas has not passed unquestioned, and
those who wish to see a brief and clear account of
the latest theories on the subject should read Mr
Crooke's paper on "Rājputs and Marāthas" in
Vol. <small>XL.</small> (January&mdash;June, 1910) of the <i>Journal of
the Royal Anthropological Institute</i>. Mr Crooke,
who gives copious references to the latest literature
on the subject, holds that "the theory that a Hun
or Scythian element is to be traced in the population
of the Deccan is inconsistent with the facts of tribal
history, so far as they can now be ascertained." Mr
Crooke thinks that the anthropometrical facts can
be explained otherwise than by Saka invasion and
an infusion of Scythian blood. "The presence of
a brachycephalic strain," he says, "in Southern and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">{53}</a></span>
Western India need not necessarily imply a Mongoloid
invasion from Central Asia. The western coast
was always open to the entry of foreign races. Intercourse
with the Persian Gulf existed from a very
early period, and Mongoloid Akkads or the short-headed
races from Baluchistan may have made their
way along the coast or by sea into Southern and
Western India. But it is more probable that this
strain reached India in prehistoric times, and that
the present population is the result of the secular
intermingling of various race types, rather than of
events within the historical period." Mr Crooke's
view is supported by the recently issued Census
Report of the Bombay Presidency, which says, "the
term Marātha is derived by some from two Sanskrit
words, <i>mahā</i>, 'great,' and <i>rathi</i>, 'a warrior.'"
According to Sir Rāmkrishna Gopāl Bhandārkar it
is derived from Rattas, a tribe which held political
supremacy in the Deccan from the remotest time.
"The Rattas called themselves Mahā Rattas or Great
Rattas, and thus the country in which they lived
came to be called Mahārāttha, the Sanskrit of which
is Mahā-rāshtra."</p>

<p>Indigenous names are frequently Sanskritised,
much as we turn French <i>chaussée</i> into "causeway."
Sometimes the change is so complete that the
original cannot be identified. In some cases the
alteration is easily recognised. In Northern Bengal,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">{54}</a></span>
for instance, is the river <i>Ti-stā</i>, a name which belongs
to a large group of Tibeto-Burman river names beginning
with <i>Ti-</i>, or <i>Di-</i>, such as <i>Ti-pai</i>, <i>Di-bru</i>,
<i>Di-kho</i>, <i>Di-sāng</i>, etc., etc. Hindus say the name
<i>Ti-stā</i> is either a corruption of Sanskrit <i>Tri-srotas</i>,
"having three streams," or of Tṛṣṇā, "thirst." Etymology
and legend, in fact, give but doubtful guidance
to the ethnologist, and the best hope of acquiring
some real knowledge of Rājput and Marātha origins
lies in the possible discovery of coins and inscriptions
in the absence of direct historical records.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II<br />
<small>THE LANGUAGES OF INDIA</small></h2>

<p>It is quite possible to live many years in one
province or another of India without obtaining more
than the vaguest conception of the linguistic riches
of the country. It was Sir G. A. Grierson who
rendered it impossible for any but the most careless
to ignore the fact that India has not only more
languages than Europe, but many more kinds and
families of speech. Most Europeans in India live in
the populous areas where ethnical and geographical
conditions are favourable to the evolution and spread
of one of the great literary languages. In Madras,
the European comes into contact with one or other
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">{55}</a></span>
of the cultivated Dravidian tongues. In Bombay, he
learns that Marāthi and Gujarāti have ancient and
interesting literatures. In Calcutta, he is surrounded
by millions of Bengalis, who in modern times have as
many varieties of literary expression as the most
advanced of European races. In Rangoon, he hears
the most highly organised of Tibeto-Burman speeches.
In Allahabad, Benares, Lahore, Patna, he acquires
some smattering of the beautiful and expressive
languages which are closest to the model of the
original Indo-Aryan idiom. These are the exact
counter parts of the great literary languages of
Europe, of English, French, German, Italian, etc.
But while the European mountains contain one or
two shy survivals at most of primitive ways of talking,
India has many languages of the type of Basque. In
the little frontier province of Assam alone, dozens of
grammars and vocabularies have been printed, and
much more remains to be done. Happily, an appetite
for more information has been aroused by the feast
spread before linguists in Sir G. A. Grierson's great
<i>Survey</i>. He himself is at work on a book which will
tell us all that is at present known about the many
languages of India, and their relations with one
another. But in addition to his own labours, Sir
George Grierson has been an apostle of linguistic
research and has gathered round him many disciples,
not all of whom recognise whence came the impulse
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">{56}</a></span>
that has set them to an examination of the history
and growth of Indian languages. Most promising
sign of all, native scholars no longer disdain the
living tongues of India, nor confine their studies to
the classics of Sanskrit, Arabic, and Persian. In
Bengal alone, the Proceedings of the <i>Vangiya Sāhitya
Parisat</i>, a society for the pursuit of linguistic and
ethnological research, now form a goodly library of
books, and the poet, Rabindranath Tagore, whose
own English version of his charming <i>Gitanjali</i> is in
the hands of all who love poetry or are interested
in Indian matters, is also a very keen and competent
student of his native language on lines suggested by
the enquiries of European scholars. Much has been
learnt, but linguistic research in India has still many
interesting secrets for the zeal of European students to
reveal. In Scandinavia, Germany, France, a new sense
of the value of such studies has been aroused. All
that can be attempted in the following pages is to show,
very summarily and briefly, what is known at present.</p>

<p>We have already seen that there are seven more
or less recognisable types of Indian humanity. To
these roughly correspond five great families of living
vernaculars. The Turko-Iranian, the Indo-Aryan, the
Scytho-Dravidian, the Aryo-Dravidian, and the Mongolo-Dravidian
races have for the most part acquired
Aryan languages which, in their relations to Sanskrit
and Persian, may be compared with the Romance
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">{57}</a></span>
languages of Europe in their relations to literary
Greek and Latin. The Dravidian races speak one
or other of the great Dravidian dialects, or some
idiom of the Mundā languages of Chota Nagpore.
Among the Mongoloid races of the extreme north
and east of India, we find the Mon-Khmer and the
Tibeto-Chinese families of speech. Of these, the
Dravidian family seems to be confined to India&mdash;to
the high tablelands of Southern India, with one outlying
settlement among the Brāhuis of Baluchistan.
This Dravidian speech would seem to be the original
and indigenous language of India. The Mundā
languages of Chota Nagpore, again, are plainly very
ancient Indian tongues and are, in all probability, as
aboriginal as the true Dravidian speech. But Mundā
tongues have elements in common with the Mon-Khmer
languages of Further India, Malacca, and
Australonesia. The present explanation of this fact
is provided by the supposition that, in prehistoric
times, these distant regions shared a common language
with great part of Northern India. But, for all
practical purposes, the relations of the Mundā
languages with the Far East are still so vaguely
defined, that they may be provisionally regarded as
being as indigenous as their neighbours, the Dravidian
languages. The connection of the Mon-Khmer languages
with Further India and the Pacific have formed
the subject of the now famous researches of Pater
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">{58}</a></span>
Schmidt of Vienna and other German investigators.
The Indo-Chinese family of languages is obviously
connected with the many dialects of Southern China.
An Indian journalist once told me that he thought
that the tumbled mountain ranges which separate
India from China and form, for the time, a semi-savage
"no man's land" of primitive social customs
and administration, are the most interesting area on
earth. It is an Asiatic and a huger Albania, of whose
ethnological and linguistic condition much has yet to
be learned. Those who heard Mr Archibald Rose's
lectures in London and Cambridge on his travels in
these regions will easily realise how much room there
is here for anthropological and linguistic research
among the rough but attractive races of this quarter.</p>

<p>Lastly, in the great alluvial plain which separates
the Himalayas from the tableland of the south, and
along the western coast, are the peoples who use one or
other of the great Aryan vernaculars, languages of much
the same type as the modern languages of Europe,
sharing much of their vocabulary, and ultimately
derived from similar if still obscure origins. It is of
all these languages, and of some of their innumerable
dialects (not all of them even now known by name),
that some account must be given in this chapter.</p>

<p class="gap-above">The history of the languages of India has reflected
the long struggle for pre-eminence between the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">{59}</a></span>
indigenous Dravidian culture of the south and the
Aryan civilisation of the north. The Mundā languages
are those of an isolated group of highlanders, who, till
quite recent times, hardly came into contact with or
were influenced by the speech or thought of other
races. The Mon-Khmer-speaking people of the Khasi
Hills were similarly wholly isolated, and were long
supposed to be absolutely aboriginal and separate
from other races of men, till quite recent investigations
discovered their linguistic affinities with the
Mons of Southern Burma and races in French Indo-China.
The Tibeto-Burman languages of the north-eastern
frontier are the simple and primitive speech
of semi-savage men. For such languages, contact
with the Aryan languages means rapid decay and
dissolution.</p>

<p>Hindu civilisation and Hindu religion find easy
converts in the rude and simple Mongoloid people
of the north-east, and acceptance of Hindu manners
and customs almost always results in a rapid change
of language. So again, the Iranian languages represent
the final stage in the advance of Islam and
its languages as a conquering religion. The Iranian
tongues of the north-western frontier are only Indian
in the fact that they happen to fall within the administrative
border of British India. If we omit all
consideration of these races and languages for the
present, we shall be free to consider the long struggle
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">{60}</a></span>
between the Aryan and the Dravidian. The Aryan
religion, the religion of the Hindus, has spread all
over India, and as the Dravidian temples of the south
are among the glories of Hindu religious architecture,
so the Hinduism of the south is now, in many ways,
the most typical and interesting form of the religion.
The spread of the Aryan blood has been far less wide
in extent, as the previous chapter sufficiently shows.
The Aryan languages have spread all over the north
of India, up to an irregular line running obliquely
across the peninsula from near Vizagapatam on the
east coast to near Goa on the west coast. Into the
Aryan area projects the rocky plateau of Chota
Nagpore, where the Mundā dialects still survive,
and there are a few other outlying areas where
Dravidian tribes still use the original language of
India. With these exceptions, Northern India, from
Bombay to Calcutta now speaks Aryan languages.</p>

    <p>Seoris or Savaras<br />
    (<i>Mirzapur district</i>)</p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Let me then begin by giving a brief account of
the two ancient and indigenous families of language
in India, the Dravidian and Mundā families. Sir
G. Grierson's <i>Survey</i> has definitely established the
fact that, in spite of the close physical resemblance
between the Dravidian races properly so called and
the inhabitants of Chota Nagpore, there is no
linguistic affinity between them. In Sir George
Grierson's own words "they differ in their pronunciation,
in their modes of indicating gender, in their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">{61}</a></span>
declensions of nouns, in their method of indicating
the relationship of a verb to its objects, in their
numeral systems, in their principles of conjugation,
in their methods of indicating the negative, and in
their vocabularies. The few points in which they
agree are points which are common to many languages
scattered all over the world."</p>

<h3>The Dravidian Languages.</h3>

<p>These are, as aforesaid, the languages of Southern India. Two of
them survive further to the north in Chota Nagpore
and the Sonthal Parganas, where they exist side by
side with Mundā dialects. One curiously isolated
Dravidian language is Brāhui, an extraordinary survival,
far to the north-west, in the midst of the
Iranian and Muhammadan languages of Baluchistan.
The Sanskrit writers knew of two great southern
languages which they named the Andhra-bhāshā and
the Drāvida-bhāshā. The first corresponded to what
is now Telugu and its cognates, the latter to the rest
of the southern languages. Sir George Grierson
classifies the Dravidian family thus:</p>

<p>Sir G. Grierson borrows the following general
account of the main characteristics of the Dravidian
forms of speech, with slight verbal alterations, from
the <i>Manual of the Administration of the Madras
Presidency</i>:</p>

<p>"In the Dravidian languages all nouns denoting
inanimate substances and irrational beings are of the
neuter gender. The distinction of male and female
appears only in the pronoun of the third person, in
adjectives formed by suffixing the pronominal terminations,
and in the third person of the verb. In all other
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">{63}</a></span>
cases, the distinction of gender is marked by separate
words signifying 'male' and 'female.' Dravidian
nouns are inflected, not by means of case terminations,
but by means of suffixed postpositions and separable
particles. Dravidian neuter nouns are rarely pluralized;
Dravidian languages use postpositions instead
of prepositions. Dravidian adjectives are incapable
of declension. It is characteristic of these languages,
in contradistinction to Indo-European, that, wherever
practicable, they use as adjectives the relative participles
of verbs, in preference to nouns of quality or
adjectives properly so called. A peculiarity of the
Dravidian (and also of the Mundā) dialects is the
existence of two pronouns of the first person plural,
one inclusive of the person addressed, the other
exclusive. The Dravidian languages have no passive
voice, this being expressed by verbs signifying 'to
suffer' etc. The Dravidian languages, unlike the
Indo-European, prefer the use of continuative participles
to conjunctions. The Dravidian verbal system
possesses a negative as well as an affirmative voice.
It is a marked peculiarity of the Dravidian languages
that they make use of relative participial nouns
instead of phrases introduced by relative pronouns.
These participles are formed from the various participles
of the verb by the addition of a formative suffix.
Thus 'the person who came' is in Tamil literally 'the
who-came'."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">{64}</a></span>
It is worth while, for once, to quote this somewhat
technical description because it shows that though
the Aryan languages have driven the Dravidian
languages out of Northern India, the latter may
have affected the Aryan speech in the transition
which, in common with the corresponding speeches
of Europe, it has undergone from inflected to analytic
ways of talking.</p>

<p><i>Tamil.</i> Tamil, or Arava, is spoken all over the
south of India and the northern part of Ceylon.
It extends as far as Mysore on the west coast and
Madras on the east coast. It has been carried all
over Further India by emigrant coolies. As might
be expected from its geographical position, it is the
oldest, richest, and most highly organised of Dravidian
languages. It has an extensive literature written in
a literary dialect called "Shen" or "perfect" as
compared with the colloquial "Kodum" or "rude"
speech of ordinary men. The words "Tamil" and
"Drāvida" are both corruptions of an original
"Drānida." Tamil has an alphabet of its own.</p>

<p><i>Malayalam.</i> Malayalam is a branch of Tamil
which came into existence in the ninth century <small>A.D.</small>
It is the language of the Malabar coast, and has one
dialect, Yerava, spoken in Coorg. This language has
borrowed its vocabulary freely from Sanskrit. It
differs from the mother tongue in having dropped
the personal terminations of verbs. Its alphabet
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">{65}</a></span>
is the Grantha character, much used in Southern
India for writing Sanskrit.</p>

<p><i>Kanarese.</i> Kanarese is the language of the
Kingdom of Mysore and the adjoining British
territory. It has an ancient literature written in
a character resembling that of Telugu. Its dialects
of Badaga and Kurumba are spoken in the Nīlgiri
hills. Kodagu, the language of Coorg, is said
by some to be a dialect of Kanarese, and is the
link between it and Tulu, the language of part
of South Kanara in Madras. Toda and Kota will
always have an interest for anthropologists in connection
with Dr Rivers' now classical investigation
into the social life of the Todas.</p>

<p><i>Gond.</i> The Gond language is spoken outside the
true Dravidian area, in the hill country of Central
India. It is intermediate between the Drāvida and
Andhra languages, and like most hill languages has
many dialects. It is unwritten and has no literature.</p>

<p><i>Telugu.</i> Telugu is the only important Andhra language
now surviving. It is the language of the eastern
coast from Madras to near the southern border of
Orissa. It has an extensive literature written in a
character of its own, adapted from the Aryan Devanāgari.
This character, like the writing of Orissa, is
easily recognised by its loops and curves, said to be
due to the difficulty of writing straight lines with a
stylus on a palm leaf without splitting the leaf.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">{66}</a></span></p>

<p>Finally there remains the isolated and distant
Brāhui language in Baluchistan. Its separate existence
has led to a very pretty quarrel between linguists
and ethnologists. Dr Haddon in his work on the
<i>Wanderings of Peoples</i>, in this series, says that
"the Dravidians may have been always in India:
the significance of the Brāhui of Baluchistan, a small
tribe speaking a Dravidian language, is not understood,
probably it is merely a case of cultural drift."
Sir George Grierson says "if they (the Dravidians)
came from the north-west, we must look upon the
Brāhuis as the rear-guard; but if from the south,
they must be considered as the advance guard of the
Dravidian immigration. Under any circumstances
it is possible that the Brāhuis alone retain the true
Dravidian ethnic type, which has been lost in India
proper by admixture with other aboriginal nationalities
such as the Mundās." My own diffident suggestion
is that the Brāhuis may be a Dravidian race as
a survival of emigration when Northern India was
also Dravidian, as the French are a "Latin" race.</p>

<p>Of the Mundā languages I need not speak at any
length, interesting as they are to students of spoken
speech. They are spoken by over three millions of
people, and, besides numerous dialects of each, are
six in number. They have been carefully studied by
missionaries and others, and many of them are now
recorded in the Roman character.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">{67}</a></span>
I must apologise for a somewhat dull and detailed
account of the Dravidian languages. It seemed
necessary to explain what manner of languages they
were that fought an unequal and not always losing
fight with the great Aryan languages of the north.
The account of the struggle between the two, on
the other hand, has an enduring interest. Dravidian
and Aryan languages now face one another much as
do French and Breton in Brittany, English and Gaelic
in the Highlands, Flemish and French in Belgium.
But in the Indian plains the contest was waged on
a much vaster scale, and some of the incidents of the
long struggle can still be recovered. One point
should be carefully borne in mind. In Northern
India the Aryan languages and the Hindu religion
are openly and completely victorious. The peculiar
philosophic and religious ideas of Hinduism find apt
and copious expression in the Aryan vocabulary of
the north. But Dravidian India, too, in accepting
Hinduism, perforce accepted with it much of the
Aryan vocabulary. It is Dravidian still, as England
is still mainly Germanic. But without Aryan words
it could hardly give expression to Hindu speculations
and aspirations. As our own language, as these
words I write, have a strong intermixture of Latin
phrase and idiom, so the Aryan influence has in
a greater or less degree penetrated to Ceylon itself,
once held by Aryan poets to be the home of demoniac
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">{68}</a></span>
and barbarian races. There are Dravidian traces
in the north, survivals of old days of Dravidian
supremacy. In the south, a veneer of Aryan culture
has been added to the ancient Dravidian civilisation.
This was strong to resist a change of idiom: it clung
sturdily to most of its vocabulary; but there has
been an infusion of Aryan words, needed for ritual
and, in some cases, for administrative purposes. The
use of the word "administrative" reminds me to say,
before passing on, that nowhere in India is English
so freely used as in the Dravidian south. Originally
Englishmen seem to have found Dravidian languages
too difficult a means of communication. But Dravidians
themselves soon discovered that English was
a convenient <i>lingua franca</i>. All India is now making
the same discovery, and English is binding the educated
classes into a new pan-Indian race.</p>

<h3>The Aryan Languages.</h3>

<p>We now return to the fascinating story of the
spread of the Indo-Aryan languages over the north
and west of the peninsula. In the tale, captured
from the patient study of words and idioms, and
finding only occasional support from legend, and
practically none from history, since history had not
yet begun to exist, we get a singularly moving and
interesting picture of the social existence of vanished
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">{69}</a></span>
tribes of men. We partly know and partly conjecture
that there was once a race of men whom we may conveniently
call Indo-Europeans who spoke the parent-speech
of the modern languages of Europe, Armenia,
Persia, and northern India. Probably the Panjāb in
very early times was occupied by several immigrations
of Indo-European folk, for in the earliest days of
which we have any knowledge, the land of the Five
Rivers is already the home of many Indo-Aryan
tribes, who live at enmity with one another, and
have a fraternal habit of speaking of one another
as unintelligible barbarians.</p>

<p>In the Sanskrit geography of somewhat later
times, India is divided into the sacred Madhya-deça,
the "Midland," and the rest. Already this Midland
country, the home of the latest immigrants, is considered
to be the true habitat of civilised Aryans, all
the rest of the peninsula being more or less barbarous.
It is important that the reader should understand
exactly where this Midland lay. On the north it
ended below the foot-slopes of the Himalayas. On
the south, it was bordered by the Vindhyā hills, the
southern boundary of the Gangetic plain. On the
west it extended to Sirhind on the eastern limits of
what is now the Panjāb. On the east its limit was
the confluence of the Ganges and Jumna. Its inhabitants,
of mixed Aryan and Dravidian origin, had
spread eastwards from the upper part of the <i>do-āb</i>,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">{70}</a></span>
the watershed between the two rivers. Their language
gradually became the current speech of the
Midland. It was cultivated as a literary tongue
from early times and came to be known as Sanskrit,
the "purified" language. Purified and systematised
it was by the labours of grammarians and phoneticians,
the most famous of whom is Pānini, who
lived and wrote about 300 <small>B.C.</small></p>

<p>To the phonetic acumen of these early grammarians
the existing alphabets of northern India,
singularly different in arrangement from the confused
order of European and Semitic letters, bear testimony.
In the Indian alphabets the letters are arranged in
order, according to the vocal organs chiefly used in
their pronunciation, as Gutturals, Palatals, Cerebrals,
Dentals, and Labials. All the phonetic changes
which occur in the formation of the numerous compound
words are carefully reduced to rule, and the
spelling professes to be (what perhaps no spelling
ever has been or can be) phonetic.</p>

<div class="section"></div>

<div class="image-center" style="max-width: 368px;">

  </div>
</div>

<p>It is a moot point whether Sanskrit was in Pānini's
time a spoken vernacular. It is more probable that
it was, what it still remains in most parts of Hindu
India, a second and literary language, used much as
Latin was used in medieval Europe. The spoken
form of the archaic language found in the older
Vedas developed into Prākrit, which existed side
by side with Sanskrit as the spoken dialects of Italy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">{71}</a></span>
existed side by side with literary Latin. As the
Italian dialects developed into the modern languages
of Europe, so the Prākrits gave birth to the Aryan
modern languages of India. Thus the latter were
not in any accurate sense derived from Sanskrit, but
only shared a common origin with it<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_4" id="Ref_4" href="#Foot_4">[4]</a></span>.
It remained, however, as a standard of literary perfection and
was destined to play an important part in the enrichment
of many of the modern languages of India,
when contact with western culture brought about
what may fairly be called a literary renaissance.
This was particularly the case with Bengali. Its
medieval literature was all but confined to rhymed
hymns and tales. English education led to a revival
of Sanskrit studies. From England Bengal learnt
that it was possible to write prose in many varied
forms, in novels, essays, histories, journalism, and so
forth. The medieval literary language, derived from
the Prākrit, had grown insufficient for the expression
of anything but the simplest devotional or amatory
emotion, and Bengali borrowed freely from the rich
treasury of Sanskrit.</p>

<p>In the "Midland," then, were various forms of
Prākrit, side by side with the sacred and literary
Sanskrit. Round the Midland, on the west, south,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">{72}</a></span>
and east lay territories inhabited by other Indo-Aryan
tribes. This country included what is now the Panjāb,
Sind, Gujarāt, Rājputānā and the country to its east,
Oudh and Bihār. The tribes inhabiting this semicircular
tract had each of them its own dialect. But
it is important to note that the dialects of this "Outer
Band" were much more closely related to one another
than to the spoken language of the "Midland." It
was this circumstance which suggested Dr Hoernle's
ingenious theory, already mentioned, of the second
and separate invasion of Aryans into the Midland
over the mountainous passes of Gilgit, too high,
arduous, and difficult to be traversed by the families
and herds of the nomad newcomers.</p>

<p>In course of time the population of the Midland
grew in numbers and valour and pressed closely on
the food supplies of the tract. It was already the
centre of a vigorous and widely influential civilisation.
It contained the imperial cities of Delhi and Kanauj,
and the sacred city of Mathura
(<span title="Modoura ê tôn Theôn">Μόδουρα ἡ τῶν θεῶν</span>,
as Ptolemy calls it). This crowded, vigorous, and
martial population was bound to expand. It spread
into the eastern Panjāb, Rājputānā, Gujarāt and
Oudh, carrying with it its language. Hence, as Sir
George Grierson points out, we get in this "Outer
Band" mixed languages, of the Midland type near
the "Midland" centre, but fading into local dialects
as we go further west, south, and east. Finally as the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">{73}</a></span>
Midlanders crowded into the territories of the Outer
Band, the inhabitants of these took refuge among the
Dravidians of the south and east, and so gave birth
to dialects which ultimately became Marāthi in the
south and Oriyā, Bengali and Assamese on the east, all
of them characteristic languages of the "Outer Band."</p>

<p>I am borrowing so freely and unscrupulously from
Sir George Grierson that it is a relief to pause for a
moment to interpose a very diffident suggestion of
my own. Vocabulary, and even idiom, have become
a dubious guide to the constituent elements of the
"Outer Band" languages which have almost entirely
destroyed the original vocabularies of the Dravidian or
Mongolo-Dravidian races who use them. But it is just
possible that accentuation, rhythm, metre may furnish
some clue to these vanished dialects, which may have
bequeathed a characteristic tone of voice to their
Aryan successors. Bengali, for instance, has a very
peculiar initial phrasal accent which strongly distinguishes
it from the etymologically cognate speech
of Bihār, much as the characteristic <i>accent tonique</i>
of French distinguishes it from Italian and Spanish.
Native scholars in Bengal are, I am glad to say,
beginning to work at the Dravidian elements in their
expressive and copious language, and will, I hope,
soon investigate the Mongolian elements, whether of
idiom or pronunciation, in the Bengali of the north-eastern
part of the province.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">{74}</a></span>
To return to Sir George Grierson, he holds
that the present linguistic condition of northern
India is this:&mdash;there is, firstly, a Midland Indo-Aryan
language which holds the Gangetic Doāb.
Round it on three sides is a band of Mixed languages,
in the eastern Panjāb, Gujarāt, Rājputānā
and Oudh. With these Sir George includes the
Indo-Aryan languages of the Himalayan slopes
north of the Midland, which have been introduced
in comparatively recent times by immigrants from
Rājputānā.</p>

<p><i>The Prākrits.</i> Before I leave the Aryan languages
of India, I must give a brief summary of what Sir
George Grierson says of the Prākrits, the spoken
speeches which have always, implicitly or explicitly,
been distinguished from the artificial and
literary Sanskrit. The Primary Prākrits of the
Midland and Outer Band (of which latter no record
survives) were of the same type as the Latin known
to us in literature. They were synthetic and inflected
languages. These gradually decayed (or developed)
into what Sir G. Grierson calls the Secondary Prākrits.
These are still synthetic, but diphthongs and harsh
combinations of consonants are avoided, "till in the
latest developments we find a condition of almost
absolute fluidity, each language becoming an emasculated
collection of vowels hanging for support on an
occasional consonant." These Secondary Prākrits
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">{75}</a></span>
lasted from the days of the Buddha (550 <small>B.C.</small>) to
about 1000 <small>A.D.</small></p>

<p>One at least of these Secondary Prākrits, Pāli,
has obtained world-wide fame as the language of the
Buddhist scriptures. Thus crystallised, it underwent
the same fate as Sanskrit and became more or less
what we call in Europe a "dead" language. In the
Midland was a great and famous Prākrit called
Sauraseni, after the Sanskrit name, Surasena, of the
country round Mathura. In Bihār was Māgadhī;
in Oudh and Baghelkhand was Ardha-māgadhī or
"half Māgadhī"; south of these was Mahārāshtri,
which is best known to students of the ancient Indian
drama as the vehicle of the lyrics with which the
plays are studded. Kings, sages, heroes and other
noble characters speak Sanskrit. Inferior personages
use Sauraseni.</p>

<p>The Secondary Prākrits themselves degenerated
into what Indian grammarians call Apabhramsas,
"corrupt" or "decayed" tongues, which were used
for literary purposes and finally became the parents
of the great Aryan languages of the present time.</p>

<p>For comparison with the preceding table of the
Dravidian languages, I give below the census table of
the Aryan languages as recorded in 1901:&mdash;</p>

<p>Of all these modern languages, their idioms, their
characters, their literature, I do not venture to give
even a summarised account. Those who have any
curiosity to learn more about them cannot do better
than consult Sir George Grierson's work on <i>The
Languages of India</i>, until it, in its turn, is superseded
by the book he is now writing from the materials
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">{77}</a></span>
collected in his <i>Linguistic Survey</i>. But everyone
who has read <i>The Newcomes</i> will want to know what
Hindustāni is, especially as it is one of the languages
prescribed for the study of probationers for the
Indian Civil Service and is taught at the universities
of Oxford, Cambridge, London, and Dublin. In the
strictest sense Hindustāni is the dialect of western
Hindi spoken between Meerut and Delhi. It was
much cultivated, as a literary dialect, by both Hindus
and Musalmāns. The latter wrote, and write it,
in the Persian character, and have added a large
number of Persian and Arabic words. In this
Persianised form it is known as Urdū, "a name
derived from the <i>Urdū-e mu 'alla</i>, or royal military
bazaar outside the imperial palace at Delhi, where it
is supposed to have had its origin." Under Muhammadan
rule Urdū was almost as much the <i>lingua franca</i>
of India as English has come to be in modern times.</p>

<p>Another point is worth noting here. The Aryan
languages of northern India are, in a very real sense,
Hindu languages. Perhaps I shall make myself clearer
by asserting that the languages of Western Europe
are Christian languages. For historical reasons, their
religious phraseology has a Christian connotation and
allusiveness. But in the west, the distinction between
things secular and things religious has become so
familiar that the Christian element in our speech is
not recognisable in our ordinary talk. In Hindu
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">{78}</a></span>
India, on the other hand, almost every act of a man's
life has some religious or superstitious significance,
and hence all the Aryan languages in the mouths of
Hindus are markedly different from the shape they
assume when spoken by Musalmāns. In the case of
western Hindi we have the recognised Muhammadan
dialect of Urdū, but in other languages too there is
a Muhammadan dialect or <i>patois</i>, even if it has no
separate name. A curious exception, however, occurs
in eastern Bengal, where the bulk of the population
is Musalmān. In this region the Muhammadans are
comparatively recent converts from the lower aboriginal
or Mongoloid castes, whose Muhammadanism
sits very lightly on their habits and consciences, and
so far as my own experience goes, there is little
difference between the speech of the lower Musalmāns
and their friends and cousins the Chandāls and
other indigenous castes.</p>

<h3>The Indo-Chinese Languages.</h3>

<p>Finally, I must say a few words about the Indo-Chinese
and Mon-Khmer languages. I spent most of
my official life among people speaking these languages,
and find, somewhat shamefacedly, that Sir G. A.
Grierson makes me responsible for sundry vocabularies
compiled in my distant youth. Naturally, I
feel a personal interest in the people of the north-eastern
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">{79}</a></span>
border, and am tempted to enlarge on their
qualities of speech and character. But I have left
myself little space, and the Mongoloid races of the
frontier are hardly Indian in any proper sense of the
word. Moreover, though their total number is not
great, they speak many languages. The Census of
1901 recognises 119 such languages. The most important
of them all is, of course, Burmese, which is
spoken by about seven and a half millions of people.
There are nearly 900,000 Karens in Burma, and
about 750,000 Shans. The Meithei (now Manipuris)
mentioned above are 272,997 in number. The Boro
or Kachari people of the Assam valley, a most attractive
and delightful race, number somewhat less than
250,000. The other languages of this type have
mostly a much smaller number of speakers than these.
But mention should be made of 250,000 Mons, Palungs
and Was in Burma, and 177,827 Khāsis in
Assam, since these constitute the only members of
the Mon-Khmer family still found within the limits
of British India.</p>

<p>These people, speaking Indo-Chinese languages,
surround India proper on the north and east in a
crescent-shaped curve, mostly in the valleys of lofty
and rugged mountains. From the eastern mountains
projects into the midst of the modern province of
Assam a range of hills, dividing the valley of the
Brahmaputra from that of Sylhet, which is watered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">{80}</a></span>
by the Surma. Readers of Sir W. W. Hunter's
delightful little book on <i>The Thackerays in India</i> will
not need to be told where Sylhet is, or what sort of
a place it is. This range of hills is inhabited by the
Garos on the west, and the Nagas on the east, both
Tibeto-Burman races. Between them, on one of the
most beautiful plateaus in the world, are the Khāsis,
once, as I have said elsewhere, regarded as being as
isolated and unique as our European Basques, but
now proved to be, linguistically at least, connected
with the Mons in Burma, and many races and tribes
in Further India and Australonesia.</p>

<p>All these Indo-Chinese people seem to have come
originally from north-western China, following the
beds of great rivers in their travel; down the Chindwin,
the Irrawaddy, and the Salween into Burma,
down the Brahmaputra into Assam, and up the Brahmaputra
into Tibet. There seem to have been at
least three waves of migration. First, in prehistoric
times, there was a Mon-Khmer invasion into Further
India and Assam. Next, also at an unknown date,
was a Tibeto-Burman invasion into the same regions
and Tibet. Next the Tai branch of the Siamese-Chinese
entered eastern Burma about the sixth
century <small>A.D.</small> A fourth Tibeto-Burmese invasion,
that of the Kachins, when in Lord Dufferin's time,
the British annexed Upper Burma.</p>

<p>I think I have now said enough to show how the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">{81}</a></span>
languages of India are distributed. It only remains
to give a brief and cursory account of the Indian
Religions. This is a subject on which big books
might be, and have been, written. But, even in so
small a book on the Peoples of India it seems necessary
to give some account of their religious divisions.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="nodent"><a name="Foot_4" id="Foot_4" href="#Ref_4">[4]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;
As in Europe, the modern Aryan languages differ from one
another chiefly in survivals from the indigenous earlier speech
which preceded each of them.</p>

</div>

<h2>CHAPTER III<br />
<small>THE RELIGIONS OF INDIA</small></h2>

<p>(1) <i>Animism.</i> At the base of all the religions,
perhaps at the base of all religions all over the
world, lies a mass of primitive beliefs, not perhaps
yet consciously classed by the holders of them as
distinctly religious, which are called by the question-begging
name of Animism. By this statement, I mean
merely that many of the more ignorant and simple
folk who profess and call themselves Hindus, Buddhists,
Jains, Muhammadans, or Christians, are in
fact at the animistic stage of intellectual evolution.
The religious impulse is there, but has not become
specialised. There is no religious theorising, but
merely communal and transmitted beliefs about the
nature of things in general. Perhaps I had better
quote Sir H. H. Risley's definition of Hinduism as it
exists in India. "It conceives of man," he says, "as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">{82}</a></span>
passing through life surrounded by a ghostly company
of powers, elements, tendencies, mostly impersonal in
their character, shapeless phantasms of which no
image can be made and no definite idea can be
formed. Some of these have departments or spheres
of influence of their own: one presides over cholera,
another over small pox, another over cattle disease;
some dwell in rocks, others haunt trees, others, again,
are associated with rivers, whirlpools, waterfalls, or
strange pools hidden in the depths of the hills. All
of them require to be diligently propitiated by reason
of the ills which proceed from them, and usually the
land of the village provides the means for their
propitiation."</p>

<p>If this definition, that of a kindly and experienced
student of primitive thought and emotion, be correct,
there is already an attempt at analysis and classification.
But the analysis is feeble, the classification
very elementary. The differences which seem obvious
to the civilised man, who inherits the analytic inventions
and investigations of long series of ancestors, are
not yet realised. There is practically no distinction
between things animate and inanimate, since all may
be maleficent and must therefore, on occasion, be
propitiated. There is no sense of things subter-human,
human, and superhuman. Still less, of course, is there
any recognition of the difference between things religious
and things secular. Grown men face the facts
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">{83}</a></span>
of life as children do, and receive the impressions
life conveys to them <i>en masse</i>, without making much
effort to sort them out. In our own case, we learn
to classify from our elders, and classification, literary,
scientific, social, religious, is a large part of what we
call education. How does primitive man begin to
sort out the facts of life, to remember them in classes,
to discriminate between human beings and other
animals, to place animals above inanimate things,
himself above animals, and, finally, the gods above
himself? The history of the evolution of Hinduism
throws some light on this evolution as it occurred in
India.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, it is worth noticing that the Census
returns of 1901 returned the Animists of India at
only about 8½ millions, or less than 3 per cent. Those
who returned themselves as Hindu or Musalmān
were so recorded, whatever their degree of mental
and social culture. An attempt has been made in the
Census of 1911 to distinguish between true Hindus
and Animists who call themselves Hindu. How far
the attempt was successful, I do not know. I can
well believe that it was not welcomed even by
educated and intelligent Hindus. Many years ago,
I remember a highly educated Hindu in Bengal telling
me that there is no distinction between Animists
and Hindus; that an Animist is merely a Hindu "in
the making" as it were. But perhaps that assertion
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">{84}</a></span>
only amounted to an admission that the Hindu mind
is averse from the kind of intellectual evolution by
conscious analysis and classification which is dear to
Western imaginations. Yet the history of Hinduism
and its branches shows that such an evolution has
taken place.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p>I should like to suggest that at the stage of
human evolution which we call animistic, man takes
the facts of life in the lump, as it were, and does not
sort them out into classes. If we are to judge by
what we know of the history of Hinduism, the evolution
of primitive man from this unclassifying stage
is something as follows. Art comes into play. The
practice of song and draughtsmanship introduces
specialisation. From singing comes verse, from
drawing comes some kind of rude writing. The first
trains the memory, the second aids memory. Then
comes the social classification which results from the
breaking up of clans, and contact with other clans
and communities. All men are not the same, and
the difference is grasped and finds expression in
language. The new power of classification is extended
to other things. The difference between
animate and inanimate things is understood, and
their relative powers of helping or hurting the tribal
community. When classification has proceeded thus
far, the inference is easy that as what is known of
the faculties of subter-human beings and things to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">{85}</a></span>
benefit or hurt humans does not by any means
account for the joys and calamities of life, there
must be a class of superhuman beings who are to
be conciliated. By their supposed deeds they are
judged. If they are, on the whole, kindly and easily
placated, they will be classified by some title which
they will usually share with great and good men. If
their action on mankind be harmful, they will bear
the names given to malicious or inimical races or
individuals. At a subsequent stage of analytical
evolution their generic names will be confined to
their own class; they will be gods or demons. Many
Hindus have hardly gone beyond this stage, and we
can hardly be surprised that some objection should
be taken to too rigid a distinction between Hindus
and Animists. In practice, it is often difficult to say
whether a given observance is Animistic or Hindu.
Here is one case, out of thousands that occur in India,
from my own experience. In the seaport town of
Chittagong is the shrine of the famous Muhammadan
saint Pir Badr, a holy man often invoked by travellers
on sea or river. In a niche in a little pillar in the
open air, Christians and Buddhists, Hindus and
Musalmāns alike place lighted candles by way of
propitiation. This, surely, is an observance of the
Animistic type. It has no part in any theorised or
classified religious system. It is merely the attempt
to gratify an influence which may help or harm.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">{86}</a></span>
Animism is consistent with the most vivid, if childlike,
curiosity. All is grist that comes to that
primitive mill. But the resulting flour of thought
is, as it were, coarse and unsifted. Artistic specialisation,
the birth of literature, brings a need of
classification. Out of propitiation comes ritual, a
belief in the efficacy of sacramental gestures, offerings,
formulæ. But, as time goes on, they are
appropriated to the service of highly specialised
deities. As man learns the advantage of a division
of labour and a specialisation of function, so his gods
become "departmental." The classification will not
be that of modern times. Among animate things
will be reckoned fire, and air, the sun and moon and
the twinkling stars. But the process of analysing
and sorting will have begun.</p>

<p>(2) <i>The Vedas.</i> The Aryan immigrants seem to
have brought a scanty and summary theology with
them, or it may be that in different surroundings
they forgot their old religious ideas, and, with the
help of Dravidian and other aboriginal speculations,
evolved new ones. Sir G. Grierson has suggested
that the fact that they migrated in two afterwards
hostile bodies finds its reflection, in the Vedas, in the
fabled antagonism of the rival priests Visvāmitra and
Vasishta; in the Mahābhāratā in the famous war
between the Kauravas and Pāndavas, the Eastern
counterpart of the siege of Troy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">{87}</a></span>
The Vedas are four collections of ritual hymns,
used in connection with the oblation of the intoxicating
juice of the Soma, the moon-plant, or with the
sacrificial Fire. The Rig-veda (the oldest) and its
supplement the Sāma-veda are now held to have
been composed when the Aryans had reached the
junction of the Panjāb rivers with the Indus: the
Black and White Yajur-veda when they reached
the Sutlej and the Jumna; the Atharva-veda, which
contains the lower beliefs of aboriginal races, when
they had reached Benares. There are gods and
goddesses of the sky, the most important being the
Sun, and Varuna (the Greek <span title="ouranos">οὐρανός</span>),
afterwards a kind of Hindu Neptune, but in these early days
represented as sitting in the vault of heaven, and
having the sun and stars as the eyes with which he
watches the doings of men. His function was to
encourage personal holiness as a human ideal. In
the mid-air Indra became pre-eminent on Indian soil,
where the dependence of an agricultural people on
periodical rains made the rain-god an important
deity. On earth the most important deities are
Soma and Agni (fire) already mentioned. There was
also Yama, the beautiful and stately god of death,
who though naturally immortal chose to die, and
lead the way for mortal successors to the abodes of
the dead. Besides the departmental gods, there is in
the Vedas a distinct foreshadowing of Pantheism.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">{88}</a></span></p>

<p>(3) <i>The Brāhmanas.</i> When the Aryans reached
the "Midland," the upper Gangetic valley, the Vedic
hymns were supplemented by new Scriptures, called
Brāhmanas, which were digests of dicta on matters
of ritual for the guidance of priests. These were the
beginning of Brāhmanism. The elementary Pantheistic
theory of the Vedas was developed into a belief
in one Spiritual Being or Ātman. When manifested
and impersonal, this Being was the neuter Brahma;
when regarded as the Creator, he was the masculine
Brahmā; but when manifested in the highest order
of intellectual men, he was Brāhman, the Brāhman
priestly class. Following the Brāhmanas, was a
third order of religious literature, the Upanishads.
Dr Hopkins has thus summarised the teaching of
these three Scriptures. "In the Vedic hymns, man
fears the gods. In the Brāhmanas man subdues the
gods, and fears God. In the Upanishads man ignores
the gods and becomes God." Not that these three
kinds of Scripture, these three evolutions of religious
speculation, followed one another in chronological
order. But this was, roughly, the logical evolution.
Finally the doctrine was established that knowledge
leads to the supreme bliss of absorption into Brahmā,
and with this was combined the theory of transmigration.</p>

<p>Even from this extremely crude and simplified
statement, it will be evident that the priesthood had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">{89}</a></span>
secured for themselves an unexampled supremacy,
and, in the Midland at least, had placed the administrator
and warrior in a state of marked inferiority.
But in the surrounding territories, success in arms
and government won men the consideration still considered
their due among ourselves. In the Midland
itself the territory was divided among a number of
petty chiefs, who waged perpetual warfare with one
another. They were not likely to ignore the prestige
won by valour and warlike skill. One of them was
Gautama, the Buddha (<i>c.</i> 596-508 <small>B.C.</small>). Another
was Vardhamāna, his contemporary, the founder of
Jainism. This is not the place to tell of Buddhism,
which, as a recognised creed, though it has spread
far to the north and east, and is the religion of
Ceylon and Burma, only survives in India proper in
faint influences on the belief and practice of various
Hindu sects.</p>

<p>(4) <i>Jainism.</i> The Jain Reform still exists and
numbers over a million of followers. Its doctrines
have a vague and general resemblance to those of
Buddhism, not because either copied the other, but
because they sprang from a common origin. In both
Nirvāna, the "blowing out," as it were, of the lamp
of life is the goal aimed at. But to the Buddhist,
Nirvāna means the peace of extinction; to the Jain,
it is final escape from the body after various metamorphoses.
Mr Crooke defines the fivefold vow of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">{90}</a></span>
the Jains as prescribing (1) the sanctity of human
life; (2) renunciation of lying, which proceeds from
anger, greed, fear or mirth; (3) refusal to take things
not given; (4) chastity; (5) renunciation of worldly
attachments. The Jain pantheon consists of deified
saints who are either Tīrthan-kara, "making a passage
through the circuit of life," or Jina, "the victorious
ones."</p>

<p>(5) <i>Hinduism Proper.</i> These reforms, joined
with the spread of the Brāhmanical faith into lands
where the authority of Aryan priests was not recognised,
produced something which, in its way, resembles
the Protestant Reformation. The Vedic religion had
come to be the monopoly of a limited order of
hereditary priests. This ritual supremacy was broken
up by two influences. A new national ideal of worship
found expression in the Epics, which to this day, in
metrical translations, are the layman's scripture all
over India. Secondly, the Vedic pantheon was
enormously enlarged by the admission of non-Aryan
deities and aboriginal modes of worship. Hence arose
the body of writings known as the Purānas, or "ancient"
books, not all really old in the trace of their composition,
but perhaps deserving their title as containing
very old beliefs. Of all these books and their teaching
other authorities have written recently in various
works on the early history and religious poetry of
India, and it would therefore be presumptuous for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">{91}</a></span>
me to say anything about the religious literature of
Hinduism. It is sufficient to say that the Epics introduced,
in place of the vague and shadowy Vedic
gods, heroic incarnations of divine virtue, wisdom and
valour, and thus led to the sectarian worship of the
two active members of a new supreme triad of gods,
Brahmā, the creator, Vishnu, the preserver, and Siva,
the destroyer. Most Hindus are now followers of one
or other of the two latter in some incarnation. In
early times this sectarian rivalry led to wars and
persecutions, but Hinduism is singularly tolerant in
matters of belief and doctrine. A Saiva is not a
disbeliever in the divinity of the incarnations of
Vishnu; a Vaishnava recognises the ascetic powers
of Siva. But each has his favourite deity and chiefly
studies the scriptures relating to him. The principal
incarnations of Vishnu are Krishna and Rāma, who
seem to have been originally deified heroes of the Midland.
There were many Vishnuvite reformers, some of
whom, it is interesting to note, may have derived suggestions
from the early Christianity of Southern India.</p>

<p>The first of these was Rāmānuja, who lived in the
eleventh century <small>A.D.</small> Fifth in succession to him was
Rāmānanda, who lived in the fourteenth century and
was the missionary of popular Vaishnavism in Northern
India. To him that tract owes the prevalence of the
cult of Rāma and his wife Sītā, the hero and heroine
of the Epic known as the Rāmāyana. His chief
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">{92}</a></span>
innovation was the admission of low-caste disciples
into the communion. His disciple, the famous Kabir
(1380-1420 <small>A.D.</small>), went further. He even linked
Hinduism with Islam. Himself a humble weaver,
he taught the spiritual equality of all men. God is
one, he argued, by whatever name men choose to call
Him. The accidents of life, social station and caste,
happiness and grief, prosperity and misfortune, are
all the results of Māya or Illusion. Happiness comes
not by formula or sacrifice but by passionate adoration
(<i>bhakti</i>) of God. Kabir's chief importance in
the history of Hindu evolution is in the fact that his
doctrines were the origin of Sikhism.</p>

<p>Another great name in the democratic Vaishnava
reformation was that of Chaitanya (1485-1527 <small>A.D.</small>).
Mr E. A. Gait writes of him that he was "a Baidik
Brāhman. He preached mainly in Central Bengal
and Orissa, and his doctrine found ready acceptance
among large numbers of the people, especially among
those who were still, or had only recently ceased to
be, Buddhists. This was mainly due to the fact that
he drew his followers from all sources, so much so
that even Muhammadans followed him. He preached
vehemently against the immolation of animals in
sacrifice, and the use of animal food and stimulants,
and taught that the true road to salvation lay in
bhakti, or fervent devotion to God. He recommended
Rādhā worship, and taught that the love felt by her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">{93}</a></span>
for Krishna was the highest form of devotion. The
acceptable offerings were flowers, money, and the
like; but the great form of worship was the Sankirtan,
or procession of worshippers playing and singing. The
peculiarity of Chaitanya's cult is that the post of
spiritual guide, or Goshain, is not confined to Brāhmans,
and several of those best known belong to the
Baidya caste<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_5" id="Ref_5" href="#Foot_5">[5]</a></span>."</p>

<p><i>The Sikhs.</i> As a religious system, the creed of
the Sikhs originated from the Hindu teaching of
Kabir, and may yet be reabsorbed into Hinduism,
though the Census of 1911 shows that it still flourishes
as a separate religion. It began as a religious reform
and ended by being a political organisation. It was
founded by the Guru Nānak (1469-1538 <small>A.D.</small>) in the
Panjāb. Its formula was the Unity of God and the
Brotherhood of Man. Ultimately it became a martial
brotherhood, one of whose objects was by training,
diet, and self-denial to present a strong front to the
encroachments of Muhammadan invaders from across
the north-west frontier. Circumstances led the Sikh
confederacy to try its fortune in arms in two fiercely
fought campaigns with the growing power of our East
India Company. Defeat was followed by a loyal
acceptance of British supremacy, and the Sikhs rival
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">{94}</a></span>
the Gurkhas as the best soldiers in the Indian army.
Their services during the mutiny of 1857 will never
be forgotten.</p>

<p><i>The Sāktas.</i> One other great Hindu sect, that of
the Sāktas, must be briefly mentioned. It worships
the active female principle (<i>prakriti</i>) of one or other
of the forms of the Consort of Siva&mdash;Durgā, Kāli, or
Pārvati. This cult arose in Eastern Bengal or Assam
about the fifth century, <small>A.D.</small>, and has its own scriptures
in the Tantras. This sect is probably due to the
recrudescence of very ancient aboriginal cults. It
is associated with blood-offerings and libidinous rites.
It was denounced by the Vaishnava reformers, but
still survives, even among educated men. It affected
the later forms of Buddhism.</p>

<p>Finally, by omitting all mention of numerous
modern Vaishnava sects, we come to the modern
Theistic sects. The Brahmo Samāj of Bengal was
founded by the celebrated Raja Ram Mohan Roy
(1774-1833) who died and was buried at Clifton.
His teachings were continued and developed by his
successors Maharshi Devendranāth Tagore (the father
of the poet Rabindranāth Tagore), Keshav Chandra
Sen, and Pratāp Chandra Majumdār. All of these
were men of much piety, eloquence, and learning.
Sir Alfred Lyall says that "Brahmoism, as propagated
by its latest expounders, seems to be unitarianism of
a European type, and as far as one can understand
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">{95}</a></span>
its argument, appears to have no logical stability or
<i>locus standi</i> between revelation and pure rationalism;
it propounds either too much or too little to its
hearers." It has, however, been an effectual bar
to the spread of Christianity among the educated
classes in Bengal. It enables them to remain in
touch with Hinduism, from which an adoption of
any European creed would effectually divide them.
Its services of praise and prayer, with a sermon or
discourse, are held on Sundays, and in form resemble
those of the Christian free churches. Its creed consists
in a belief in the Unity of God, the brotherhood
of man, and direct communion with God without the
intervention of any mediator. It may fairly be
claimed for it that it has satisfied the religious needs
of men most of whom lead exemplary and in some
cases saintly lives, without compelling them to join
what is regarded as a foreign and uncongenial
religion. But for Ram Mohan Roy, educated Bengal
might well have furnished the nucleus of a Christian
Church of India, since, before his time, many distinguished
and able converts were made. I need
only mention the late Rev. K. M. Bannerjee. The
Brahmo Samāj is divided into three sections. The
Ādi Samāj, as its name indicates, is the original
church. It is the most conservative of the three,
and takes its inspiration wholly from the Hindu
scriptures, and especially from the Upanishads. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">{96}</a></span>
Navavidhān Samāj, founded by Keshav Chandra Sen,
"the Church of the New Dispensation," is much more
eclectic and has borrowed what it considers acceptable,
not only from the holy books of Hinduism, but
from Christianity, Buddhism, and Islam. The Sādhāran
(or "general") Brāhmo Samāj is the most
advanced of the three Churches. It rejects caste
and the seclusion of women, allows inter-caste
marriages, and is seemingly as far from orthodox
Hinduism as from orthodox Christianity. It has
even allowed one of its lady members to be married
to an Englishman by Brāhmo rites. If it can hardly
be called Hindu in ritual or in belief, it is Hindu
in what is probably regarded as the more important
sense of being a purely Indian sect and not a direct
product of European missionary zeal.</p>

<p>Another new sect, the Ārya Samāj, or Aryan Society,
has much influence in the Panjāb and North-Western
India generally. It was founded by Dayānand Saraswati
(1827-53). Its only scriptures are the Vedas.
It professes pure monotheism, repudiates idol worship,
and is much interested in social reform. It has also
at times been mixed up, more or less directly, with
political agitation. Like the Brāhmo Samāj, it is
probably due in its inception to the influence of
European religious teaching, but, as is perhaps
natural, its acceptance of European ethics is marked
by a sturdy resistance to European dogma.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">{97}</a></span>
The great bulk of Hinduism, however, remains
still but little removed from the Animistic stage
of religious evolution, and one of the results of
the spread of British rule into wild and savage tracts
has been the extension of the borders of Hinduism
in competition with Christianity. In the rougher
and wilder races, not yet sufficiently softened and
civilised for the acceptance of the Hindu social
system, the Christian missionary prevails. He has
been most successful among the Gonds of Central
India, among such savage tribes as the Nāgas, Gāros,
and Lushais on the Assam border. Elsewhere
Hinduism pursues its quietly imperturbable course
and admits savage races to its lower castes as it
has always admitted them during the last two
thousand years.</p>

<p><i>Islam in India.</i> Since King George V has
more Muhammadan subjects than any other ruler
on earth&mdash;some 75,000,000 in number, it would not
be proper to close a little book on the Peoples of
India without saying something of those of their
number who are Musalmāns. The early Muhammadan
invasions of the tenth century were mere predatory
raids, and were attended neither by settlement nor
conversion. But at the end of the twelfth century
Muhammad Ghori overthrew the Hindu dynasties
of Delhi and Kanauj and thus opened the way to
future Muhammadan conquests. In the sixteenth
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">{98}</a></span>
century Moghal rule was established under Babar
and his successors. During the preceding five
centuries Hindu India suffered much oppression
and wrong at the hands of Muhammadan invaders,
but Islam had made no attempt to become an
Indian religion. The early Moghal emperors were
too busy in consolidating their conquests and organising
their administration to have much leisure or
inclination for proselytising. Their policy depended
largely on co-operation with Rājput princes, whose
daughters they married. The influence of Rājput
empresses and princesses made for kindly tolerance.
It was only under the zealot Aurangzeb that any
tendency to forcible conversion showed itself.</p>

<p>The final result of some seven hundred years of
Muhammadan rule in various parts of the country is
that Musalmāns are in excess of Hindus only in the
Western Panjāb, which is in contact with a purely
Muhammadan country, and in Eastern Bengal, where
the aboriginal low-caste Hindu was glad to get social
promotion by accepting Islam, and where he thrives
and prospers at the expense of his Hindu brother,
partly because his diet is more nutritious, partly
because he does not practise infant-marriage and
other debilitating customs.</p>

<p>As has been said above, Animism has affected
Islam as well as Hinduism. From the old religion of
the country Musalmāns have borrowed demonology,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">{99}</a></span>
a belief in witchcraft, and the worship of departed
Pirs or saints. The most remarkable instance of the
latter is the sect of the Pachpiriyas of Bengal, the
worshippers of the Five Saints, a cult which some
have traced to the cult of the five Pāndava heroes of
the Mahābhārata. The five Pirs, however, vary in
name from district to district. In Eastern Bengal,
no one, whether Hindu or Musalmān (or, I had
almost said, Christian), begins a journey by boat
without a loud and hearty invocation of the Ganges,
the Wind, the Five Pirs, and Pir Badr before
mentioned.</p>

<p>Of the two great sects of Islam, the Sunnis and
the Shias, the former are by far the most numerous
in India. The Sunnis or Traditionalists accept the
Sunnat or collected body of Arabic usage as possessing
authority concurrent with that of the Koran,
which is the sole scripture of the Shias. Yet in
Eastern Bengal the annual procession of the Tazias,
or representations of the tombs of the martyred
grandsons of the Prophet, is much attended by
Sunnis (though for them the practice is unorthodox),
and indeed by Hindus also. In other parts
of India, the Mohurram festival has often led to
serious encounters between Hindus and Musalmāns,
and even in Calcutta and Bombay has been the
cause of dangerous riots.</p>

<p>The sects of Islam in India, unlike the Hindu
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">{100}</a></span>
sects, are not due to the instinct for differentiation,
for obvious reasons. They are, in Mr Crooke's
words, either puritanical or pietistic. Consequently,
followers of them are apt to show a tendency to
fanaticism. The Hindu sectarian adores some favourite
deity, but does not deny the merits, or the
Hinduism, of other deities or their followers. The
Musalmān sectarian is one who has discovered a
higher orthodoxy than others, or a straighter road
to religion, and regards those who do not share his
views as an enemy of God and the true faith. Of
the puritanical sects, the best known is that of the
Wahābis, founded by Ibn Abdul Wahāb at Nejd in
Arabia, at the beginning of the eighteenth century.
It was an attempt to revive primitive Muhammadanship
without the corruptions and accretions of later
ages and foreign lands. It was brought into India
by Sayid Ahmad Shāh, who proclaimed a Jihād, or
holy war, against the Sikhs in 1826. The Wahābis
hold that the doctrine of the Unity of God has been
endangered by the excessive reverence paid to the
Prophet, to his successors the Imāns, and to shrines.
At times Wahābis have given trouble to the administration,
especially in Bengal. In recent years,
however, they call themselves Ahl-i-hadīs, or "followers
of tradition," and employ themselves chiefly in
endeavouring to eradicate modern superstitions.</p>

<p>The pietistic sects tend towards Sūfi-ism, a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">{101}</a></span>
combination of Aryan pantheism with Semitic monotheism,
which takes the form of ecstatic devotion.
Something of the same kind may be found in the
Vaisnav sects of Hinduism, and in both cases ultimate
absorption in the divinity is the goal aimed at.</p>

<p>Very interesting local communities of Muhammadans
are the Moplahs of the Malabar coast,
descendants of Arab settlers; the Bohras or
"traders" of Western India; and the Khojās, followers
of the "Old Man of the Mountain," whose
present representative is H.H. the Agha Khān of
Bombay, who has many friends in England.</p>

<p><i>The Pārsīs.</i> The word Pārsī simply means Persian,
and the Pārsī religion is the dualistic faith, combined
with fire-worship, of the ancient Persians. It is also
called Mazdaism from Ahura Mazda (Ormuzd), who
is in perpetual conflict with Angro Mainyush (Ahriman),
the spirit of evil. It is also called Zoroastrianism,
from the reformer Zoroaster, the Greek form of
the old Iranian Zarathushtra, the modern Persian
Zardusht. The religious phraseology of the Pārsīs
shows that their faith must have had a common
origin with the Aryan religion of India before the
Iranian and Indo-Aryan migrations parted company.
By a curious trick of language, the Devas, who in
India and Europe are beneficent gods, in Persia
become evil spirits. In India by a corresponding
inversion, the word Asura, which in the Rig-veda
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">{102}</a></span>
is still a name of gods, was applied to hostile (generally
aboriginal) demons. By a further process Asura
was regarded as a negative word, and gave birth to a
tribe of beneficent Suras. In the earlier times, there
were both Ahura and Daeva worshippers, the former
being socially superior, cattle-breeders, who, like the
Indian Hindus, venerated the cow. It was Zoroaster's
mission to fuse these two cults into a dualistic creed,
whose main principle was the continuous struggle
between the powers of good and evil. Submerged
for a time during the Greek occupation, the Mazdaist
faith revived under the Sassanids, but was finally
overthrown by the advent of Islam, which persecuted
and strove to extirpate the worship of fire.</p>

<p>Many of the survivors migrated to India, where
they secured the tolerance of Hindu and Muhammadan
rulers alike, and increased and multiplied. Up to
the middle of the eighteenth century, Surat, Nausāri,
and the neighbouring parts of Gujarāt were their
home. When, under British rule, Bombay became
a great commercial port, large numbers of Pārsīs
migrated thither, and in many cases won great
wealth and influence.</p>

<p>In the early days of their dispersion, the weak
colonies of Pārsīs assimilated themselves with the
lower classes of Hindus by whom they were surrounded.
But fresh accessions from Irān, and a
growth of national prosperity and self-confidence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">{103}</a></span>
brought about a restoration of the ancient faith. On
Indian soil, the Pārsīs now number 94,000. But owing
to their intelligence and wealth, due to their remarkable
success in trading, the Pārsīs command a much
wider political and social influence than their numbers
would seem to show. According to Pārsī belief, the
soul passes after death to paradise (Bihisht) or a
place of punishment (Dozakh) according to a man's
conduct in life. Much importance is attached to the
performance of rites to the <i>manes</i> of ancestors. Fire,
water, the sun, moon, and stars were created by Ahura
Mazda, and are venerated, as is Zarathushtra the Prophet.
Soshios, his son, will some day be reincarnated
as a Messiah, and will convert the world to the true
faith. As with other Indian religions, contact with
Europeans tends to produce laxity of belief and
conduct.</p>

<p><i>Christianity.</i> It is interesting to remember that
there were Christians in India before the Christian
faith reached our islands. The tradition that St
Thomas was the Apostle of India, and suffered
martyrdom there, is indeed discredited. This tradition
originated with the Syriac <i>Acta Thomae</i>, and
was accepted by Catholic teachers from the middle
of the fourth century. The Indian King Gundaphar
of the <i>Acta</i> is undoubtedly the historical Gondophares,
whose dynasty was Parthian, though his territories
were loosely considered to extend to India. A full
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">{104}</a></span>
account of the traditions connecting St Thomas with
India (by W. R. Philipps) will be found in vol. <small>XXXII.</small>
of the <i>Indian Antiquary</i>, 1903, pp. 1-15, 145-160.</p>

<p>The term "Christians of St Thomas" is often
applied to the members of the ancient Christian
churches of Southern India which claim him as their
first founder, and honour as their second founder a
bishop called Thomas, who is said to have come from
Jerusalem to Malabar in 345 <small>A.D.</small> According to local
tradition, St Thomas went from Malabar to Mylapur,
now a suburb of Madras and the seat of a Roman
Catholic bishop. Here still exists the shrine of his
martyrdom on Mount St Thomas. A miraculous cross
is shown with a Pahlavi inscription which is said to
be as old as the end of the seventh century. The old
churches of the south were certainly of East Syrian
origin. They never wholly lost their sense of connection
with their mother church, for it is known that
they sent deputies in 1490 to the Nestorian patriarch
Simeon, who provided them with bishops. Under
Musalmān rule, they suffered severely, and welcomed
the advent of the Portuguese to India. They were,
however, recalcitrant to Roman influence, and it was
with much difficulty that in 1599 they were induced
to submit to a formal union with Rome at the
synod of Diamper (Udayamperur in Cochin). During
the following century and a half the Thomasine
churches were under foreign Jesuit rule, but yielded
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">{105}</a></span>
an unwilling and intermittent obedience. In 1653,
there was a great schism, and of about 200,000 Christians
of St Thomas only 400 remained loyal to Rome,
though some of their churches were soon won back
by the Carmelites. The remainder fell under the
influence of the Jacobite Mar Gregorius, styled
patriarch of Jerusalem, who reached Malabar in
1665 as an emissary from Ignatius patriarch of Antioch.
From this time, the independent churches of
Southern India have been Jacobite. At the present
time, they are on friendly terms with the Anglican
church in India, and are loosening their dependence
on the Jacobite patriarch of Antioch.</p>

<p>Of missionary work in India I need not speak in
a book of this size. There are nearly three millions
of Christians in India, of whom two and a half millions
are native converts. Seeing that missionary work
has been in operation since 1500, a tale of converts
amounting to less than one per cent. may seem a
discouraging result of over 400 years of contact with
European religious thought. But actual conversion
has taken place chiefly among the lower classes and
least advanced races. Among the educated classes
the influence of Christianity has been indirect, and
in many cases has produced a transformation in
ethical belief and social conduct as complete as could
have been wrought by open conversion. The Brāhmo
Samāj, for instance, remains Hindu in a sense, because
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">{106}</a></span>
it refuses to sever its connection with India, or to
acknowledge European authority in matters of
religion. But the Brāhmo Samāj could not have
come into existence but for Rām Mohan Roy's
friendly and intimate acquaintance with European
Christians and Unitarians. Even in the matter of
conversion, the rate of progress is increasing rapidly,
partly because missionary effort is being directed to
savage tracts hitherto unvisited by civilised men, but
partly, also, because the native Christian community
is beginning to have sufficient self-confidence and
status to proselytise in its turn. The multiplicity of
missionary agencies, due to the accidents of European
history and development, has been an impediment.
Such terms as the Church of England, Church of
Scotland, Welsh Baptists, American Baptists, etc.,
can have little signification for races who cannot be
expected to know the historical causes which brought
about these local varieties of Christian doctrine and
practice. There may yet arise among one of the rival
churches in India a Christian Rāmanuja or Chaitanya,
who may found a great Church of India, with a ritual,
and, perhaps, doctrines of its own. The most successful
of the Jesuit missionaries, Robert de Nobili<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_6" id="Ref_6" href="#Foot_6">[6]</a></span>
for instance, and such men as the Abbé Dubois in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">{107}</a></span>
later times, owed their success to the fact that they
assumed the habits, dress, and often the titles of
Brāhmanic ascetics. They could not assume the
dusky skin which, after all, is the first and easiest
means of gaining an Indian's confidence. They could
not wholly accept caste, they could not wink at polygamy
in the case of men whose first wives were
infertile, and who had an hereditary sense that the
lack of an heir is socially and religiously reprehensible.
Perhaps a truly indigenous Church of
India may deal with such difficulties more successfully
than men who are compelled to teach, not only the
elements of the Christian faith, but the ethical
traditions belonging to their own race.</p>

<p>In this connection, I may be allowed to conclude my
necessarily brief story of Indian races and religions
with an anecdote. Just thirty-five years ago I was in
charge of a "subdivision" in Bengal which contained
a large number of native Christians belonging to the
Church of England. There were several churches
with parsonages, and the nearest of these to my headquarters
was in the charge of a young missionary who
was glad to have an occasional chat with a young
magistrate. One day my missionary friend told me
that he had discovered with dismay that his flock
were in the habit of attending the Communion Service
in batches, according to their castes, so as not to be
obliged to drink out of the cup with men of alien caste.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">{108}</a></span>
There were Hindu Christians and Muhammadan
Christians who could not eat or drink together. He
decided that this state of things must be stopped at
all costs, as being wholly contrary to Christian teaching.
I ventured to suggest that spiritual equality is
not the same thing as social equality, but had to
admit that caste is not usually recognised as a Christian
institution. Apparently the Christians listened
to their pastor's admonition, for, a few days after, he
rode over to say that, in consequence of ex-scavengers
and ex-Brāhmans having communicated together, his
whole congregation had been put out of caste by their
Hindu neighbours. This may not, at first sight, seem
a very serious calamity. But it happened that, in the
caste specialisation which had survived among the
Christians, there were none of the community who
were barbers or midwives by caste. Christian men
were going about with stubbly chins: worse still,
Christian women were in need of help which their
Hindu sisters refused to supply. It was a difficult
situation for two young bachelors. However, I
now confess, after all these years, that I brought a
little official pressure to bear on the midwives, and
the situation was saved for the moment. In those
days, the educational policy of Government was to
give grants-in-aid to primary schools, most of which,
in this very Christian "subdivision" were either
Roman Catholic or Anglican. When next I proceeded
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">{109}</a></span>
to issue my doles according to school-population and
other educational results, I was astonished to find
that the Roman Catholic grant-in-aid had increased
greatly and the Anglican grant-in-aid had proportionally
diminished. This was the immediate (and no
doubt temporary) result of my missionary friend's
zeal. Such survivals of old beliefs are common in all
the religions of India. The main social impulse of
the people was implanted on their minds at the distant
epoch of the Aryan settlement, the sense of social and
racial inequality which has now hardened into the
caste system. To most Indians a recognition of the
importance and value of caste is the first step towards
decent and seemly conduct, towards civilised morality.
When a semi-savage hill-man begins to recognise his
inferiority to his Hindu neighbours and makes tentative
approaches with a view to inclusion in civilised
society, his first duty is to abjure the diet of pork
and rice-beer which his unregenerate appetite loves,
since these indulgences stand in the way of sharing
a meal with Hindu folk. (In other parts of India,
liquor and meat are consumed by low-caste Hindus
of aboriginal origin.) In Assam, a Kachāri first
accepts the <i>sarana</i> or "protection" of a Hindu
Goshain. He is then called a Saraniya Koch. His
next step is to abandon strong drinks, on which he is
promoted to the status of a Modāhi Koch. At this
stage, he may be fortunate enough to win the hand
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">{110}</a></span>
of a bride of pure Koch family, and, under her
guidance, acquires enough of conventional habits and
beliefs to be recognised as a Kāmtāli or Bor Koch,
and is a true Hindu, a member of a genuine Hindu
caste. Musalmāns and Christians have other social
conventions, and do not usually regard them as
essential to good manners or godliness. But their
converts retain their social superstitions and carry
them into the new surroundings, where they sometimes
come into disagreeable contact with the ethical
ideas belonging to imported religions.</p>

<p>The contact of Aryan with Dravidian races, some
three thousand years ago, brought about the beginnings
of caste, which, from one point of view, may be
regarded as a rude form of "race-protection," a
primitive system of eugenics. It is still most rigidly
enforced in the south, where the semi-Aryan classes
are in a great minority. It is most relaxed in the
Panjāb, where, though caste rules exist, the population
is, and probably always has been, as homogeneous as
our own race. French travellers in India have sometimes
said, half-humorously, that the Anglo-Indian
administrators and merchants are practically a caste
unto themselves. Bengalis have made the same
remark and have said that our Civil Service is composed
of <i>Kali Yuger Brāhman</i>, "the Brāhmans of
the Iron Age." There was once some truth in the
accusation, if accusation it be. It was not our
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">{111}</a></span>
business to interfere deliberately with caste, since
British policy from the first has been one of kindly
neutrality and toleration. Whether indirect influences
have mitigated the effect of the sentiment of caste is
a moot point. Educated Indians who have lived in
Europe see its irksomeness, and in some cases
denounce it more vigorously than most Europeans
will care to denounce a system due to historical
causes which are still partly operative. On the other
hand, railways and other facilities for travel, though
they have necessarily introduced laxity in matters of
food and contact, have probably heightened the caste
feeling by emphasising the variety of Hindu humanity
and of the customs and habits of its many races.
Hence the evolution of Indian society remains as
interesting and as incalculable as ever.</p>

<p>In a little book of this sort it has been necessary
to make many general and sweeping statements which
are not always literally true of any given part of India.
But perhaps enough has been said to show the interesting
and significant differences between the three
hundred odd millions of Western Europe and the three
hundred odd millions of India. Our business in India
has been primarily to keep the peace, to provide a
breathing-space after the social and political turmoil
that followed on the breaking-up of the Moghal
empire. The principal result, so far, has been a
notable increase in Hindu self-confidence and ambition,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">{112}</a></span>
and a growing belief among Hindus that their ancient
social system is not incompatible with industrial,
commercial, and political advance on European lines.
This belief has been much strengthened by the
modernisation of Japan, and its results. It has been
fostered by the free admission of educated Hindus to
the highest and most responsible posts in the King-Emperor's
administration. Inasmuch as that statement
brings me to the most modern development of
Hindu life and thought, I cannot do better than end
at this point.</p>

<p>The standard authority on the modern languages of India is
Sir G. A. Grierson's work on <i>The Languages of India</i> (Calcutta,

Sir G. A. Grierson is now writing on the basis of the further

away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the

and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or

by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the

of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work

phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project

  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty

  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the

  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project

from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
